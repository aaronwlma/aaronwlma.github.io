excerpt: "I'm taking a break!  More specifically, worship leader Aaron Lee is taking a break.  This means that I have three months to re-evaluate how I have distributed my resources.  In this post, I apply basic signal processing concepts to explain how I conduct a portion of my life.  This post is different from the usual production note that I write, so I hope that it is a positive indicator of the musical adventure that I plan to re-embark on!  "

Something that I really appreciate about serving in worship at FCBC Walnut is that we are always told, “Take a break if needed!”  A common trend among young adults is that their fresh enthusiasm out of college catapults them deeply into service in their local church, and then over time, because the church does what the church does, this enthusiasm eventually drives them into the pits of frustration where they eventually burn out.  Going from exhibit A to exhibit B is a slow and gradual process, and many of us will often find ourselves totally camping out at exhibit B before we even realize it.  Personally though, I’m the kinda dude that likes camping at national parks (with a fire pit, please).  So, in efforts to make sure I don’t reach the point where I pitch at tent at exhibit B, I’ve decided to take a break alongside our worship team’s three month break!

Now, I have been pretty deeply involved with helping out on my church’s Sunday services for the past eight months.  Well, deep enough to the point where I can forget the bigger picture, at times.  And so, when I say break, I am mainly referring to taking a break from this.  I don’t plan to spend the next three months vegetating my life away on the lovely couch that I have set up for myself (difficult though, I mean, look at that lovely natural light in the thumbnail image…).  As amazing as the couch is, there are goals that I have tagged to this three month period in exchange for the Sunday break.  Sounds kinda like a sabbatical.  Except I am an engineer by profession, not a pastor.  So, not really a sabbatical.  But, still kinda.  Anyway, to entertain that engineering profession side of me for once (and not the childhood me that dreamed of becoming a pastor..), I figure I would nerd out a little and bust out the lesser-known technical side of me to explain what these goals of the break are.

# Reason and Hope #1: Improve SNR

In signal processing, we often use something called SNR as one of a few metrics to determine whether our system’s signal is “good” or not.  SNR stands for signal-to-noise ratio, and it means exactly that.  “Signal” refers to the waves that we desire, and “noise” refers to the waves that we do not desire.  In general, the higher your SNR, the better.

<figure class="align-center">

    <figcaption><i>Figure 1: SNR for the Math Inclined, Courtesy of [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal-to-noise_ratio)</i></figcaption>
</figure>

Now, if you know basic fractions, you know that given this equation, there are two general ways to improve SNR.  If you increase your signal (P_signal), your SNR will go up.  Conversely, you can also decrease your noise (P_noise), and your SNR will also go up.

So, knowing this, I have personally spent extra effort in the past couple years to increase the signal output of my life.  At least, enough for me to feel that I have bettered myself as a person from year to year, even if it is only a small step.  But ever since I returned from living the solo life in SF/HK and jumped into a community of various kinds of people and places, I have to admit that this lifestyle shift has generated quite the significant amount of noise in my life.  My goal from year-to-year has always been to improve my life-SNR, especially by producing a strong signal.  But if I allow for the noise to get to me, then all the efforts spent on creating a strong signal will be offset by a high noise floor.

So, for this three month break, I will spend special attention in learning how to reduce the noise that has crept into my life.   Of course, I won’t be cutting back on creating a strong signal (that is, I definitely won’t shrink back on writing music).  I think that a moderate level of noise is good, and so I don’t believe that it is a good idea to completely cut out the noise as I have attempted in the past to do.  When you spend too much effort in creating the best anechoic chamber for yourself, you get quite the life-less space.  And so, during this three month break, I hope to actively exercise a little more patience, a little more tolerance, and a little more understanding toward the noise in my life to make the noise sound less like noise, and more like a signal.

Oh, and for those who don’t know what an anechoic chamber is, here’s one (courtesy again of [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anechoic_chamber#/media/File:Radio-frequency-anechoic-chamber-HDR-0a.jpg)) that I spent 20 hours a week working in back in the good ol’ college days:

Lots of microphones were set up and recordings captured in this kinda room…

# Reason and Hope #2: Reduce Loudness

Music mixed in the 1900s was mixed quite differently from the music in the 2000s.  While we can argue the pros and cons about each of time period, I think there is a noticeable trend toward “louder” sound in the recent decades, as digital signal processing became a hotter and hotter engineering field.  If you’re interested in this, feel free to google “the loudness war,” it is quite fascinating.  But a high-level overview of this would be that there has been a slow trend over time to boost every signal as loud as possible, and use compression to tame the peaks to make the overall recording sound “better," because at some point, louder became synonymous with better.

Recently, there has been a similar creeping increase of loudness in the things that I say and hear in efforts to push for what I believe ought to be heard.  As everything (even in the music of the 2000s), a certain amount of loudness is tolerable (and good, actually), but when you exceed the relative line of what is loud, then your signal will distort eventually, because your sound system can only handle so much before giving any more than 100% will end up with your efforts being clipped away.

<figure class="align-center">

    <figcaption><i>Figure 2: Sample of a clipped input signal, where max volumes are interpreted the same due to recording limitations</i></figcaption>
</figure>

I believe that is the same with the endeavors that I have taken in my own life.  There came a point where I found my efforts were met with diminishing or no returns, and providing any more effort would actually cause more harm than good.  I am not saying that I’ve given much to begin with, though.  Every system has its own limitations, and instead of imposing that upgrades be made in order to meet your signal requirements and expectations, it is better to be intuitive and creative with your system design to accommodate for the limitations of your system.

And so, for the three-months, I hope to speak softer, and let the music I work with speak.  Instead of participating in the loudness war by meeting loudness with loudness, I aim to acknowledge the limitations of the systems and view that less as a shortcoming, but more of a design challenge.  I’ll still keep up my production notes and whatever writing I feel compelled to do, but I’ll aim to speak in action instead of in words, and hopefully by letting my ears and voice rest, I can become more sensitive to the nuances of the community around me to respond accordingly.

Reason and Hope #3: Tame the Resonant Frequencies

Ah, resonant frequencies…they are always a pain to deal with.  It's what brings down buildings/bridges, makes rockets burn up, and what shakes the stage at my local church (lol).  There are several ways to deal with resonant frequencies.  As with all things related to recording techniques, it is always the best to treat things at the source.  But if you can't avoid that, then the next option is to just slap an equalizer on it.  Equalize the SPL (sound pressure level, for those who don’t like acronyms) by identifying the resonant frequency, observing the SPL difference, and using the equalizer to lower that frequency range’s SPL an amount equal to the difference.  From there, you have a balanced signal to work with.

<figure class="align-center">
    <img src="/images/2020/02/14/figure-3-resonant-frequency-on-a-b-of-a-sample-cello-vs-other-note.png" alt="">
    <figcaption><i>Figure 3: Resonant frequency on a B of a sample cello vs. other note</i></figcaption>
</figure>

Now, applying a filter means that whenever that frequency happens, the increase in SPL due to resonance will be digitally compensated.  Of course, slapping this EQ (equalizer) actually solves one problem and creates another, but in most cases, the newly created problem is much less of a problem to deal with than dealing with resonance.

    <img src="/images/2020/02/14/figure-4-compensated-cello-b-to-avoid-volume-differences.png" alt="">
    <figcaption><i>Figure 4: Compensated cello B to avoid volume differences</i></figcaption>
</figure>

And of course, the properties of resonant frequencies are similar to the things in life, really.  Everyone has their resonant frequencies.  If you tell me about the latest things happening in the political scene, or in Kenya, I'll be honest with you, it would be harder to care as much for it compared to things like musical integrity and intent.

Currently, there are things that are definitely resonating louder than the other aspects of my life.  And like resonant frequencies, they really need to be compensated for.  Now, resonant frequencies are not entirely bad.  Resonance is what makes people well, people.  It is also masterfully used in concert halls to create nice soundscapes.  But when resonant frequencies are not properly tamed, they run amok and destroy any meaning in the sound that you create.  And so for my third reason and hope, I aim to also spend the next three-months taming my resonant frequencies by adjusting their respective weights of beings in order to reach a more balanced state of being.

Oh, if you’re wondering who’s cello that waveform belongs to, it is Alvin’s.  His cello has ridiculous resonance in the 100-120hz range, and I usually have to add an EQ to drop it by 6.0dB or so to compensate…

# Concluding Remarks

So I admit that the ideas in this post are a little…vague.  Truthfully speaking, a lot of the goals I have for the next three months are goals that deal with stilling the soul, so it is a little difficult to put that out on the table for the world to see.  Living is a delicate process of trial and error.  As creating a good sound also is, balance is key.  To find the perfect balance requires experience, experimentation, and feedback to discern what is considered noisy, what is too loud, and how to tame things that resonate too strongly.  And so with these ideas actively in mind, I hope that the end of this three months break, the sound of my life will be juuust a liiittle more pronounced.  And hopefully, you, my readers, will get to witness the gradual shift back from exhibit B to exhibit A in the next three months.

If my far-fetched analogy stretches way too far for you, and if the cryptic game that I am playing is a lame one, then here’s the dry note for you:  You can expect to see less production notes on worship arrangements in the next three months (aside from the ones that are overdue at this point…).  I’ll be looking to listen more and speak less in the ministries that I am involved with in my church.  In regards to my music, look forward to seeing me return to experimenting with different instruments, arrangements, and musicians on my own!  Some of them are gonna be super janky, but hey, the musical journey is a marathon, not a sprint.  I got a few projects planned that I think you’ll look forward to (or cringe at how dumb we sound), so until then!
