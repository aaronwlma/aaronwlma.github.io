Be Bold.

When I left my job in NorCal, my coworkers made this huge card for me with that phrase in big, bold, orange letters.  The card stayed up on my bedroom wall for a while, but the card was mainly up there for the sentiments expressed rather than the message itself.  Strangely enough though (or not), the big orange letters kept reverberating in my head this past week as I approached "Anchored.”

Aaron’s set this week introduced two songs that we haven’t written a string accompaniment part for yet.  The first of the two, “Anchored” by Enfield, was a particularly familiar song for FCBC, and had some pretty energetic ups and peaceful downs.  The second of the two, “Yet Not I But Through Christ In Me” by CityAlight, originally had a very solemn, almost choral quality to it, but Aaron’s take on this one was a more of a mellow groove.  Since Matthew presented me the option to take one of the two, I opted to work with “Anchored,” as I felt like I already had a few thoughts swimming around as to how we could elevate the piece for worship.

The problem that I ran across in this arrangement was that my thoughts were slightly bolder than the conventional things that we play for worship.  They were thoughts that, while very helpful to elevating the piece, could demand attention from the listeners.  My biggest goal when it comes to writing string accompaniment parts for worship is to elevate the worship team and congregation to feel freer to express and meditate on the messages inherent to the song.  If the accompaniment becomes the main attraction, or becomes distracting, then I miss my objective and I consider that accompaniment a failure.  So while these ideas sounded great in my head (though play-ability is questionable), I was afraid that getting too excited would lead me to completely missing my biggest objective.

# Case 1: Can We Make It Better?

So here’s the first example of the boldness dilemma.  This is the entrance in verse one for the strings.  Usually, the comfortable, fail-safe place to enter for strings is usually when verse two starts (highlighted in yellow).  Play the root of the chord, a third up, and meh, maybe even the full triad and sneak in with a crescendo.  Done, easy.  No attention, and some fullness and color is added.  But as everyone in my industry should say, “can we make it better?”  And the answer to that is, “oh of course we can.”  This sneaky chord entrance is the most generic way to approach a string entrance for worship, and while it does provide something, it doesn’t really provide very much.

So in attempts to provide a little more, I thought it would be great to accentuate the strong four chords at the end of verse one to emphasize the assertive color change already provided by the worship team.  The goal was to prep the congregation and worship team slightly ahead of time for the elevated energy in verse two.

Compared to the typical entrance, did I make it better?  From my recording review, I think I…just made it different.  I think, if anything, having this entrance to verse 2 reminds the congregation that this piece is a high energy piece by carrying over the introduction energy.  Personally though, if it is a matter of preference, I like this entrance more than the typical.

# Case 2: Weaving In-n-Out

The other ideas that I tend to be afraid to use in worship are counter melodies.  The reason why I avoid these is because, if the counter melody is too melodic in nature, it becomes a sound that draws attention.  But recently after listening to a bunch of different instrumental tracks, I felt inspired to give them an another attempt.

<figure class="align-center">

This is the accompaniment for verse three.  What happens here is that the strings play when the vocals do not sing, and then also play when the line ends by emphasizing what happens in the guitar and the team in general.  In my head, the visualization was to have the strings dance closely with the melody, hovering around the vocals/band at times, and then assertively joining the band at times.  My goal was to weave in and out of the melodic line, but stay close enough to not draw attention by dancing in the same registers and by not busting out the Tchaikovsky.

So how about this one?  Was it too bold?  My verdict that no, it wasn’t.  Actually, after reviewing the tapes, I thought it ended up being a good idea.  The notes in the strings pointed the singers toward the end of the line.  When the end of the line came, the strings joined with the band in emphasizing the end of the line, as the next line began.  Overall, I felt like the strings did a good job in elevating the movement of the verse, and so I’m hoping that the next time I write an arrangement, I could use some more dancing and weaving elements!

# Case 3: Let's Play Together Y'all

The last bold idea that I want to talk about is having the strings play in unison.  In ensemble music, unison is rarely used.  Each string group is treated as one voice, so for all groups to sing the same thing is a pretty one-dimensional, aggressive statement (context aside).  Up until recently, I have always arranged in a manner to treat each string instrument as one voice.  Violin 2 would support and counter violin 1, cello 2 would provide bass support, and cello 1 would provide a new color when the violin color gets bland.  But after a few tape reviews, I was finding that the string group was not providing much.  Even though I believe I am pouring my heart and soul out on Sibelius, a lot of the interactions that I put in intentionally to elevate the worship team feel…mellowed or drowned out.

So, again, as the music that I have been listening to recently were instrumental tracks from an anime that explored revues, I drew inspiration from those tracks and tried to apply the ideas that I believed worked well in elevating a piece.  One of such ideas was to treat the string ensemble as one voice, instead of treating each string group (violin 1, violin 2, etc.) as individual voices.  That meant that the ensemble as a whole should sing the same thing.  That doesn’t necessarily mean sing the same notes, but it means that the ensemble should collectively provide one strong element to the worship team, instead of offering a multi-dimensional sub-piece.  As the original version of “Anchored” by Enfield had strings operate in this manner, I decided to gun for that idea as well.

Verdict?  Love it.  The strings pushed out more during parts they should push out, and the collective sound of the worship team felt much more directed and full.  It sounds obvious now, but arranging for ensembles and arranging for ensembles that are part of a band have completely different approaches that I ought to be aware of.  Ideas that sound bold or one-dimensional may work out in a band setting, because we’re playing together as band, and not as a string ensemble.

# Conclusive Remarks

Overall, compared to the other arrangements that I have written recently, I was pretty happy with how this one turned out.  I had bolder ideas that complimented the piece, and I felt like the feedback that I received in the reactions of the worship team were good ones that open up the worship environment more.  By treating the string ensemble as one voice and freeing up the strings to dance around the melody, I felt like the resulting arrangement elevated the worship team to be more open in their expression of love and faith.  I definitely believe there is a fat line somewhere that I shouldn’t cross when it comes to how strings should sound in a worship setting though, but I think I have yet to really get close to it.  Knowing that, I think allowing myself more freedom in using bold musical elements would allow me to help facilitate a genuine corporate worship experience for FCBC Walnut.  I’m excited to take what I learned this time around for the next time!  Stay tuned!
