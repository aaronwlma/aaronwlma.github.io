And I’m back!  With another title.  **This time around is Ue wo Muite Arukou by Sakamoto Ryu.**  It’s not exactly a Studio Ghibli exclusive song, but it did appear in “Kokuriko Zaka Kara,” and the song diiid make a huge impact on me, so by my executive decision, it makes the cut as the next arrangement in my Studio Ghibli music arrangement run through.  If you don’t like the song, too bad.  Sue me (just kidding please don’t, I do this out of free labor…).

Nothing is flowers and candy 100% of the time, and arranging music is no different.  While Hibike! Euphonium’s Oukasuru Wakamono was one of the most enjoyable arrangements I’ve ever had, Ue wo Muite Arukou swung heavily in the other direction.  In the original piece, the backtrack essentially loops 3 times with hardly any changes.  The first run through introduces pretty much 95% of the elements in the song, with only the voice nature changing from verse to verse.  The repetitive nature of the backtrack made me dip a little further into my library of music and pull out content from Hyouka’s acapella arrangement of this piece.  **I had very little initial content to work with, and coupling that with my quickly dwindling inspiration as well as a nearing deadline, I have to admit that I did not particularly enjoy writing this arrangement despite how lovely of a song it is.**

But the show must go on, there is always something to learn from experience, both good and bad.  I was harshly reminded in this arrangement that despite transcribing a bunch of songs up until today, I still don’t have a very creative ear for introducing new dimensions and elements to songs.  It is in part of why I partially gave up on “being a composer,” and it is also quite a humble reminder that well-made art is just the tip of the gigantic iceberg when it comes to time and effort invested.

But let’s not end on a flat note (heh).  I really appreciated the simplicity of the backtrack rhythm, and I was (again) quite surprised that simple rhythmic elements, combined with clever note selections, could generate such a full foundation for a singer to sing on.  **The quality of the song really stems primarily from how the singers decide to sing it, and so I hope this arrangement enables its musicians to be liberal with their creativity and expression.**  Each musician gets a little portion to be Alvin in Alvin and the Chipmunks where they get to show boat and show the audience how they sing, so I hope the musicians seize the moment when it comes to them.  We’ll be recording this piece this upcoming Sunday (along with other run throughs), so keep an eye out!
