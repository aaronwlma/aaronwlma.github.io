excerpt: "Arrangement notes recently have been more about breadth instead of depth, which doesn’t vibe with me all that much this week. So in this week’s arrangement note of “In Christ Alone,” I focus in on only breaking down one segment of my arrangement, in order to better demonstrate the how’s and why’s I write what I write."

Hmmmmm……

It seems that these arrangements notes recently have been a little toooo…shallow for my personal tastes.  So, instead of broadly touching on a few thoughts and ideas that I had throughout the arrangement, I guess **this time around, I’d like to be selfish and only take a look at one excerpt from this arrangement to break it down to my hearts content.**

For those who value your time, feel free to uh, hit the close button on this window now.  S’all good, no hard feelings.  But for those who are in to hurting themselves (don’t worry, I don’t judge), brace yourselves as I fumble around with words to hope to debrief the how’s and why’s I wrote what I wrote for this weekend’s remote worship recording of “In Christ Alone.”

So, without further ado!  Here’s the passage in question:

<figure class="align-center">

### The Stage

Let’s start from the very beginning, at m.66:

<figure class="align-center">
    <img src="/images/2020/05/25/excerpt-02-alternating-notes-in-the-first-measure-of-verse-4.png" alt="">
    <figcaption><i>Excerpt 2: Alternating Notes in the First Measure of Verse 4</i></figcaption>
</figure> 

Let’s start with the choice to use the alternating notes in violin 1 part.  **It’s purpose really was to piggyback off the interlude theme that exists in the** [original Shane and Shane version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2ld1wI2hT8), that Brian, our pianist this time around, also played in this recording of “In Christ Alone.”  The theme is echo-ed in the cello line prior:

<figure class="align-center">
    <img src="/images/2020/05/25/excerpt-03-alternating-pattern-in-the-original-brians-pianoing-and-in-the-cello-echo.png" alt="">
    <figcaption><i>Excerpt 3: Alternating Pattern in the Original, Brian’s Piano-ing, and in the Cello Echo</i></figcaption>
</figure>

However, the alternating pattern is reversed because of the hard pulsing that happens in the cellos (that was already introduced in the earlier verse).  The hard downbeats of each measure called for resolution, and so I felt like I had to respect that.  It works out, because the tension created in the note during the offbeat is quickly resolved every beat.

**The idea behind alternating eighths instead of alternating sixteenths was motivated by a desire to reap the benefits of the half time vibe.**  This is the fourth verse, so by now, our ears are all accustomed to hearing the piano/string sixteenth note alternating pattern.  By slowing down that tempo by half at the beginning of the verse, we create a feeling that the song has dramatically slowed down, without actually requiring the tempo to slow down.  Doing so also effectively drops the energy down discreetly to allow space for a more dynamic build.

To me, **verse 4 was a slight challenge, as usually by this point of the song, worship leaders usually ask for all instruments to drop out in order to build into the chorus.**  However, our worship leader wanted to hold the energy and propel that into the chorus.  My personal thought was “hold and propel?  But we are already really high energy in verse 3?  Can we even sustain that for another verse, let alone propel it again?”  But as it has been told to me, **collaboration is “yes, and” and not “no, but.”**  So, this half time line in violin 1 was my attempted solution to meet that challenge.

Let’s move on a little bit to expand it up to four bars:

<figure class="align-center">
    <img src="/images/2020/05/25/excerpt-04-countermelody-to-soften-the-forwardness-in-the-violin-2-part.png" alt="">
    <figcaption><i>Excerpt 4: Countermelody to Soften the Forwardness in the Violin 2 Part</i></figcaption>
</figure>

Now, pulsing and alternating notes is a pretty forward sound, and it grows old pretty quickly.  So, in my case, **in order to add a little bit of dimension to keep the pulsing and alternating from being braindead and obnoxious, I gave violin 2 a similar pattern, but I gave it a melodic movement** as well.  The hope was that, if the listener was honed in on the strings, they would hear a 4-bar countermelody in the violin 2 part that drives the pulsing and alternating to a resolution at m.69.

Now, that means we got three ideas going on all at the same time, and don’t forget, this is not a solo project.  We are part of a band.  When a whole lot of something is said, a whole lot of nothing is also said.  **Always remember that if you choose to give everyone in your string section something unique to say, the chances of the ideas making it out to the listener become slim.**  Even worse, you could end up muddying up the intent from others and make the whole team sound like junk.  I took a chance here with that.  But the immediate idea I want to point out here though is that the last beat of this phrase is unified among the strings.  They come together after 4 bars of their own voices.  If you take a sneak peek into the upcoming bars, you will see that again two bars later, and then collectively say the same thing from thereon.  I aimed to dance in and out of unison to fill in the transition in between the phrases in the lyrics to keep the phrase driving to the climax.  Did it work?  Or did I muddy it up?  Hmm…

### The Chaos

Alrighty, moving on.  We are now halfway through the build into the chorus, and this is now a pivot moment of the build.  With the pulsing and alternating idea, I already established that the first build is 4 bars long.  The expectation, then, is that the next idea is two bars long, and then one bar long.  Kinda like those EDM drops, where the bass drum is hit on 1-3, and then 1-2-3-4, and then 1-n-2-n-3-n-4-n, etc.  To violate that pattern would be betrayal to the listener, and if you do that, you better have a darn good reason to do it, otherwise the listener will feel filthy and cheated.

<figure class="align-center">

    <figcaption><i>Excerpt 5: The Introduced Structured Chaotic Build</i></figcaption>
</figure>

So I ain’t no cheater, I’m a loyal man.  So you can totally see, I stayed true to the expectations by having the next build phrase last 2 bars.  By now, I think you as the reader have probably noticed the elephant in the room that I keep ignoring.  And yes, you are right.  **There is an element of chaos that has crept in (and was already pretty present in the earlier 4 bars), and it’s not letting up.**  With the introduction of the triplet-sixteenths on top of the alternating eighths now echoing as a response in the cellos, it is almost quite a cluster of noise (especially if the musicians are not impeccable with their timing, phrasing, and technique).

Originally, I had the triplet-sixteenth notes last four bars instead of two (sorry, I almost cheated on you, forgive me).  But I quickly realized that I could not hold that chaos for that long, because holding this idea that long would give the listeners sufficient time to conclude that the idea is indeed braindead trash.  But holding it for two bars instead of four is just long enough to create uneasiness without letting listeners draw any quick conclusions.  **The goal of furthering the uneasiness was to make the cathartic release in tension at the end be even more liberating.**  It’s like the saying (that I am just totally going to make up right now), you only know what good food tastes like only if you know what trash tastes like.

### The Rebel

<figure class="align-center">
    <img src="/images/2020/05/25/excerpt-06-the-four-chords-leading-to-the-downbeat-of-the-chorus.png" alt="">
    <figcaption><i>Excerpt 6: The Four Chords Leading to the Downbeat of the Chorus</i></figcaption>
</figure>

So now we’ve reached the crucial two bars into the climax.  This is where things get real, and this is where you can finally reap the benefits of everything you have set up so far to drive it into a liberating release of tension, right?  Yes, but for me this time around, yes-ish.  Let me explain.

You will notice that in these two bars, I played by the rules and hit notes that were in the traditional set of notes in the chord.  The G chord has G-B-D, the A chord lands on A-C-E, and the D chord starts with D-F#-A.  **But the very last chord, the D/F#, consists of D-F#-A…C#.**

<figure class="align-center">
    <img src="/images/2020/05/25/excerpt-07-c-sharp-in-the-violin-1-part-to-force-a-dmaj7.png" alt="">
    <figcaption><i>Excerpt 7: C# in the Violin 1 Part to Force a Dmaj7</i></figcaption>
</figure>

Yes, I am being a rebel here (But not full rebel because I still have the F# on the bottom to fulfill the requirement of a slash chord, hehe).  **I insisted that the D/F# be a Dmaj7.**  The seventh of the chord creates a tension that is begging to be resolved.  Resolution could have happened here, but no, I didn’t want to stop.  In my defiance, I kept the tension going.

**This is even more abrasive and brash due to my choice of rhythm.**  If you listen to what our worship leader plays on his guitar in the last measure, it’s a spamming of 16th note, into two eighths to land on the downbeat of the chorus.  On the other hand, my arrangement calls for a spamming of triplet 16th notes, into two triplet 8th notes.  Aside from the down of each beat, we do not align with the worship leader at the crucial build point.

In these two bars, I basically was saying something pretty clear in my arrangement:  we are not collectively saying the same thing.  **By transforming the last chord, and by opting for rhythm patterns that do not line up well with the group, I am writing out of defiance.**  “No, I am not saying what you are saying, there is something else that I want to say, in light of what you have to say, Mr. Leader.”  Now, what is it that I want to say?  Is that your next question?  If you asked that question, then my answer is “great, it’s working.  Exactly.”

On a side note, musicians who actually know what they’re doing do this like it’s just another day in the office.  I think that’s awesome, and crazy.

### The Point

Here we are now, finally, at the end of the road.  Thanks for staying with me up until now.  Just a little more, and I’ll get to the point that has been burning within me the past few days, that drove me to write like this for this week.  But before then, there is one last phrase I need to deconstruct in order for me to prime you into understanding the how and why’s I write what I write.

For the landing of the chorus, let’s take a look again at the notes I’ve selected for this chord.

<figure class="align-center">
    <img src="/images/2020/05/25/excerpt-08-landing-chord-for-the-chorus.png" alt="">
    <figcaption><i>Excerpt 8: Landing Chord for the Chorus</i></figcaption>
</figure>

It’s a G chord, and you can see that I have a G in cello 2, a B in violin 2, and a D in cello 1.  G-B-D.  Great, the standard.  What do I have then, in violin 1?

An A.  Great, another transformation.  You’d expect that with all the noise that I have been generating with my defiance, that when it matters most, the climax of the piece, I’d finally fall back in line and grant the full cathartic release of energy to the listener.  But no, true to my inspirations and ideals, I rebelled and made the G a Gadd9.

**The add9 does have a release in tension, but not quite all of it.**  This was actually a little bit of an imitation and response to Matthew’s idea in his arrangement of “Amazing Grace (My Chains are Gone).”

</figure>

Matthew releases all his tension by adhering to the G chord.  In context of his piece, I thought that was the absolute correct decision.  The build up until this off-beat resolution was to accentuate the line “my chains are gone.”  And in Chris Tomlin’s totally unnecessary addition of a braindead chorus to a delicate hymn, yes, I do believe that this is the line that every congregation member should scream at the top of their lungs as the climax (in their heart, presumably, cause we’re an Chinese Baptist church yo).

Now, let’s go back to me (because it’s all about me, yo).  **The landing of this climax is on “no power of hell.”**  I’ll give you some words to mindlessly read before it sinks in.  Hm, preheat the oven to 400 degrees Fahrenheit, mix the dry ingredients into the wet for 15 minutes…did it hit you?  Of course it did, my readers are highly educated and critical (and good looking).  There’s no way (in hell) that they would accept that “power of hell” should be the strongest emphasis in this piece.

    <figcaption><i>Excerpt 10: Asserting the Climax to Come Two Bars After the Beginning of the Chorus</i></figcaption>
</figure>

This is where I finally can try and make some semblance of a point.  **To me, the strongest aspect of this verse in “In Christ Alone” needs to be the understanding that, while the power of sin and schemes of man are great, the power of God’s sovereignty is greater.**  This is why while, the 8-bars prior to the chorus drive to the down beat of the chorus, the true release of tension and energy comes on the G chord two bars later on “pluck me from his hand.”  That is why the second bar of the chorus, on “can ever pluck me from his hand" elevates to highs not heard throughout the whole piece (and totally copies [Romantic Flight from How to Train Your Dragon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9TanR_3M0o&t=78s)), and that is why the cellos have a hard, HARD, hitting triplet 8ths underneath an accelerating run in the violins.  **The goal of the 10 bars was ultimately to aid in propelling the congregation to what I believe is the absolute strongest message in this modern hymn.**

### Concluding Remarks

So there you have it, a more in depth break down of how I settled on writing what I wrote for the climax of “In Christ Alone.”  I think it goes without saying, but I think that writing with consideration and intent is absolutely important in worship arrangements.  As an arranger, the sky really can be your limit.  **When you’re presented with a blank check, you should really take the time and thought to try and understand what the blank check can be used best for, for others.**

There is the age old debate that floats among the Christian worship circle that tries to write definitions surrounding what constitutes a worshipful manner of musicking, but I really do believe it boils down to this.  **Our congregation is not dumb, they know the difference between musicking out of self-indulgence and self-satisfaction and musicking from genuine cries of the heart.**

**As long as you take the genuine worship you conduct in your heart every day, and pen that into your music, I think that any idea you end up going with won’t hurt the souls of the genuine worshippers, because they can recognize a Gospel-centered effort.**  I guess, to a certain degree, this is another interpretation of the age old saying (that I didn’t make up), “music is universal.”  I do believe that while my worshipping intent was deeply imbued into my writing, the execution probably was not 100% something that I can stand behind.  But you know as they say (making things up again), nothing tried, nothing learned.

Til the next note!
