excerpt: "Arrangement notes recently have been more about breadth instead of depth, which doesn’t vibe with me all that much this week. So in this week’s arrangement note of “In Christ Alone,” I focus in on only breaking down one segment of my arrangement, in order to better demonstrate the how’s and why’s I write what I write."
