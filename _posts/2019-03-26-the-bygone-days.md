I always find it amusing that I refer to song titles by what I feel is the easiest to verbalize.  Peaceful Days?  Nah, Heion Naru Hibi.  But Umi no Mieru Machi?  Nah, a Town with an Ocean View.  Needless to say, “Porco Rosso - The Bygone Days” is much easier to express than “Kurenai no Buta - Kaerazaru Hibi,” so that’s what ended up being the title for today’s recording notes.

Moving on though, the slump from last month’s arrangement continued into the audio edit for Bygone Days.  As all producers of art know, slumps and walls are nothing particularly rare when it comes to creating things, so I am not particularly concerned about whether I “truly enjoy music” or not.  But unfortunately, with all collaborative things, a lot of times your team will not wait for you to be ready.  **A deadlines a deadline, so even if you aren’t vibing well with the project at hand, you have to somehow figure yourself out to get something out.**  For me, Bygone Days was one of these projects, and so this was the result.

Motivation aside, the biggest lesson I was reminded of in this recording is that studio recording is **hard**.  Like, incredibly hard.  When I recorded myself for the very first time in high school, I was shocked to hear how awful I was.  I was sitting there listening to my very first attempt to record myself, and all the imperfections were fired straight into my ears from 1cm away.

The brain is pretty good at getting people to hear what they want to hear, and this is no different when it comes to live performances.  **But in studio recordings, you have a microphone 8-12 inches away, so it gives significantly less room for your brain to conjure up a sound that it wants you to hear, since the sound is…just right there.**  For live recordings, the 8-12 inches becomes 4-5 feet.  By that distance, the sound has already blended with the environment and your fellow musicians, which allow for your brain to cook up whatever it wants to hear.

Since we mic from 8-12 inches away from the audio source, each of my imperfections do not go unnoticed.  Missed a note and want to slide into it?  I hear it, and everyone else will too.  Came in late?  I hear it, and everyone else will too.  Anticipating the next note and you already stopped your vibrato and your pitch is already bending toward the next note?  I hear it, and everyone else will too.  This is absolutely amazing if you perfectly replicate what you want to express in that moment, but unfortunately the ability to do that doesn’t come easy.  **When what I play from 8-12 inches away is pounded back into my head, I run into the unfortunate truth that I am not Itzhak Perlman.**

This is precisely why practice is so important.  Perhaps, in live recordings or performances, I can get away with anticipating notes and stopping vibratos a split second before the next.  But in studio recordings, where these things are easily heard, I have to have intention for every. Single. Note.  Because I can’t rely on my brain to create a narrative for me, and I can’t rely on my audience’s brain to create a narrative for them.  **Practice needs to be carried out with the intention of determining intent for every note, and practicing needs to be carried out so that you project that intent 100% of the time without fail.**  The audio recording for Porco Rosso’s Bygone Days was a painful reminder of that.

But it’s never good to throw yourself down in the dumps without securing a ladder to climb out of it.  Knowing that practicing to determine intent and producing consistently is vital to studio recordings has opened some opportunities to adapt to the weaknesses that were brought to light. 

**With that said, we are moving away from trying to produce group studio recordings every month and moving toward producing group studio recordings every other month.**  In between those months, we will aim to record on our own (at home), and mesh it all together post process.  I hope that by doing this, I would allow us to take responsibility on an individual level for our passion to the degree we feel sufficient.  Instead of sight-reading music on a specific day, now I can get a month per piece to practice, refine, and record on my own time.  Hopefully, by switching up the process, I can re-calibrate and refine my own art, while creating more time to attend to the other responsibilities in my life as well.  Hopefully, the change in our routine will produce some better arrangements and recordings!
