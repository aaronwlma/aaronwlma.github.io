<hr>

Studio Ponoc's first feature film danced around thoughts on magic being, uh, magical.  Yet despite Mary's initial desire to be a practice-r of magic, the film (spoiler alert) ends with Mary deciding that she does not need magic after all, and the end credits start streaming down the screen.  Sekai no Owari then begins singing the about the transient nature of magic as the 500+ names go on and on, and I sat there needing to take a deep breath to take in the final statements of the movie and first line of “RAIN."

> Magic will one day wear off, we know that.

> <cite class="align-right">— First line of "RAIN" at the ending credits of "Mary and the Witch's Flower."</cite>

So!  With that emotion fresh in mind from 2017, I decided (again, on the whim) to take Sacloud's quartet arrangement of Sekai no Owari's "RAIN" and transcribe it for Kamaso Quartet.  Sacloud was already selling the sheets online, so it wasn't too difficult to transcribe this piece at all, minus hearing out all the parts that the big "SAMPLE" covered.  All in all, I think transcription only took me about 5 hours.  Definitely not an expensive price to pay.  Also, since this arrangement was a 1:1 transcription (other than transposing viola to cello and swapping cello 1 and violin 2 parts to fit within the instruments' respective registers...), there really isn't much I'd like to say about for arrangement notes.  Other than of course, thanks Sacloud.  **There are a few awkward parts in the arrangement, but I think the style and vibe that Sacloud approached this piece was very entertaining and enjoyable to play in an ensemble.**

# Recording Notes

So with that, we can just move straight into recording notes!  Awesome.  There's a lot I'd like to say about this, so without further ado...

### Big Idea #1: No Doctoring Here, Just Pure, Unadulterated* Music (*After Compression and EQs)

This is the part about the recording that excited me the most.  In all of Kamaso Quartet's previous recordings, I've opted to use individual miking for a plethora of reasons.  Our volume balance was never really stellar, and our dynamic range was always lacking.  Coupling these problems with our individual abilities to play consistently and accurately, I decided that individually miking each of us would allow me greater control in post-process to correct us both as a group and as individuals.

There comes with a big trade off that I am not a fan of, though.

I do not believe that string ensemble music is meant to be enjoyed in this manner.  By close miking ourselves individually and artificially changing our sounds, I feel like a lot of the organic nature and intended expression is lost.  That, and, by close miking and allowing listeners to get 4-12 inches from the sound source, we allow the listeners to hear things only the musician him or herself would normally have the misfortune of hearing.  So, while I gain the ability to become more of a god over the music we produce, **individually miking inadvertently causes our music to lose a good amount of musicality, and this is something that has always left a bitter taste in my mouth.**

But, we didn't do that this time!  Yay!  Our cellist Alvin recently moved into his new place, and so we thought it would be a fun idea to exploit his high ceilings and empty space by recording something in his place while we still could.  In Matthew's house, I have always miked ourselves individually because the acoustic principles of his rooms were less than stellar.  However, Alvin's ceilings are about 2-3 times higher than Matthew's place, and there was literally zero furniture at the time.  So I thought this would be a great chance to experiment a little and use a pair of mics in X-Y orientation to record this one.

Doing this meant that I lose my ability to be God, and that if we made a mistake, there would be no turning back.  The mistake would make it into the final recording.  As a result, I guess the better way to label this recording is a "live" recording and not a "studio" recording.

My thoughts on the result?  I love it!  Well, that's just me, personally.  There was a video by TwoSet violin recently that explored playing accurately vs playing musically.  And while they definitely went hard left with their approach for the sake of entertainment, I can resonate with them on the idea that **playing musically is more important than playing just accurately** (if I misinterpreted the message of the video, sorry, TwoSet).  Music is music because of musicality (hm..), and that comes with the expression of humanity.  Although we made mistakes and played like robots at times in this recording, I felt like that musicality really shined through, especially with the reverberation from the high ceilings.  This was achieved in part by minimizing the amount of post-process correction and placing the microphones in a position where, you know, most audience would listen to us from.  The result is that I am very satisfied with the overall color of the recording. Side bonus of this is that it minimizes the amount of work I have to do in post-process.  I appreciated that, haha.  Perhaps I'll give Matt's place a chance and try this mic configuration at his place next time!

Of course, not all is peaches and roses.  I did mention that we made some mistakes and played like robots at times.  So let’s explore that part my thoughts…

### Big Idea #2: What Are We Trying to Say Man...

In the original recording of “RAIN,” I found that there is inexplicable beauty in the first line of the song (mentioned at the beginning of my post).  "Mary and the Witch's Flower" is a film by Studio Ponoc that featured a bunch of past animators and directors from Studio Ghibli.  As a result, **the movie is quite Ghibli-esque, especially in its ability to evoke a sense of magic in its visuals and music.**  Yet despite the magic in both the production and plot, the movie concludes with Mary deciding that she doesn't need magic, after all.

As the end credit screens drop, the first line of RAIN begins with "Magic someday will unravel, we know that."  **The cadence, lyrical flow, and melodic direction of this line delivers a magical yet equally sobering emotion, as the older viewers are reminded of the magic that easily disappears with age.**  This first line excites me to no end, so let me break it down...

The line starts with "mahou wa," or "magic is."

<figure class="align-center">
    <img src="/images/2019/10/16/figure-2-first-phrase-of-rain.png" alt="">
    <figcaption><i>Figure 2: First Phrase of RAIN</i></figcaption>
</figure>

There is a rising nature in the melodic line, and it is immediately followed by a rest, or pause, or silence, or whatever you want to call it.  The result of that is that the first three notes is a strongly exclamatory and enthusiastic phrase that suggests that everything after it is of importance.  To further grab the attention of the listeners, after yelling "HEAR HEAR!" and grabbing everyone’s attention, the singer here lets the silence sink in to further built suspense and weight into what's to follow.  With this opening phrase, we are presented (in quite the strong manner) with the idea that the subject of the song is magic.

Then the line proceeds with "itsuka," or "someday/one day."

<figure class="align-center">
    <img src="/images/2019/10/16/figure-3-second-phrase-of-rain.png" alt="">
    <figcaption><i>Figure 3: Second Phrase of RAIN</i></figcaption>
</figure>

While the language phrase "someday" generally has an element of holding the suspense of whatever phrase came before, there is an important element of reversal in the melodic phrasing in the musical phrase.  "Mahou wa" was a rising melody, starting from a C and ending at an F.  "Itsuka," on the other hand, starts on an Eb and ends back at a C that we started on.  “Itsuka” takes the enthusiasm that we built, and returns us back to square one.  "Someday" effectively takes enthusiasm in the initial proclamation of "magic is," and turns the overall phrase into a phrase exclaimed with sobriety.

As another pause, silence, rest, whatever, takes over to allow us to marinate in the quick reversal from enthusiasm to soberness, and then the third phrase eventually comes in with "tokeru to," or "unravel/resolve/fade/etc."

    <figcaption><i>Figure 4: Third Phrase of RAIN</i></figcaption>
</figure>

And so finally, we reached a point in the first line that has a complete statement in English!  That is, "magic someday will unravel."  But is it really, a complete statement?  Of course, the answer is "no, it is not."  For now, let’s ignore that appending “to” at the end of “tokeru” already tells us that there’s more to come in this sentence, so that we can explore the musical side of this phrase for a second…

This phrase lands on a F, which is the dominant of Bb major, the key to which this song is arranged in.  Even if you have not heard this song before, you will feel that there is tension created by ending on the V of the key.  Conventionally, tension ought to be resolved, and so if this song follows a typical song structure and adapts an authentic cadence, then we are naturally expecting a phrase to follow that lands on the tonic.  Even if we have a complete statement lyrically, we are expecting more out of the line, because the lyrics are not aligning with the direction of the melody.  Well, in English at least.  In Japanese, it aligns with the continuity that the “to” brings to the statement.  So the cadence is supplementary to the lyrical phrasing in the native language, I guess.

So where do we land?  Of course, the tonic.  "Bokura wa shiteru," or "we know that," is a phrase that rounds out the first line of “RAIN.”

<figure class="align-center">

    <figcaption><i>Figure 5: Fourth and End of the First Phrase of RAIN</i></figcaption>
</figure>

Coincidentally, the way the phrase finishes is what fascinates me about the structure of the Japanese language.  The collective line is now "magic is, someday, unravel, we know that."  In order to translate this into an English phrase that flows well with English rules of grammar, usually you tend to see translations such as "We know that magic will someday unravel."  

But what pains me the most about such a translation is that it robs the audience of any suspense that was captured in the native language.  Each phrase of the line has the ability to quickly change the meaning and energy of the statement, something that I find that Japanese does much more richly than English does (or I don’t read enough…).  Translating the first line haphazardly takes the suspense I detailed in the past five or so paragraphs and just chucks it out the window.  Fortunately for you (if you made it this far), I detailed this line for you instead of Google translate, so perhaps you can better appreciate the way that the melodic flow compliments and dances with the lyrics in the native language.

SO.  That said, did I believe we captured the past five paragraphs in the way we played in this recording?

My answer is no.  I found no element of enthusiasm in the first phrase, no element of sobriety in the second phrase, no element of suspense in our third phrase, and no element of conclusion in the last phrase.  **Our overall recording had one element dominating any sort of expression we were gunning for--the element of not screwing up.**  Even if our hearts were screaming and our tear ducts were working overtime, our fear of screwing up ruled supreme over our nervous and muscular system, leaving us with a bland, meaningless, opening phrase.  To me, that was unfortunate.  This element of "playing not to screw up" in favor of "playing for expression" is littered across our whole piece.

**But to be fair to us, there are times where we overrule our fear and elements of our musicality shine through.**  Usually, these moments are during phrases that we sufficiently practiced, whether it be due to targeted practice or daily practice.  The practice would allow us to completely put the technical aspects of music in the backseat and let our thoughts drive the car.  The other moments are during times where we have thoroughly acknowledged our state of skill and accepted that our sub par technique will be on display for the world to hear should we allow our musicality to attempt to steer.  **My personal favorite moment of this idea (for myself) in this recording is my entrance at 1:55.**  I clipped that audio for you below if you’re lazy to scrub the video!

# Concluding Remarks

While it is unfortunate that not all of us are professional musicians able to focus on expression instead of not messing up, I think for who and what we are, this recording was a pleasure to record.  Despite our mistakes and shortcomings, I think that the transparent nature of the recording process this time around allowed for a genuine color to shine through billions of 0s and 1s at certain times.  **I feel like this recording session was an encouraging yet humbling experience that creates a bunch of action items to allow me to further improve on my musical pursuits.**  I take each recording and arrangement on a case by case nature, but hopefully we can find an opportunity to record like this again in the future!
