excerpt: "It’s been two months, but I’m back with a new cover! I really enjoy transcription projects because it allows me take a deep dive into how great composers do things. There is a lot to learn and discover in the process, and in my transcription (and recording) of Boku ni Hikari wo Kuretanda, I took special notice to how different voices interacted to paint a a beautiful picture that even encouraged me to re-evaluate my thoughts on musical integrity."

I’m back!  Yahoo!  Hard to believe it’s already been two months since my last cover.  But alas, we are back with another, because after two years (yes, years), I finally opened up some free time for myself!  I’ve reached quite the milestone in my personal life recently, so I now have about a little over 1.5 months to explore some of the musical ideas that I have been dying to get to.  So, this is one of them, haha.  I’m going to write a post on that milestone later on my other platform later this week, but I’ll be sure to link it here for those who are curious.  For now, though, let’s dig into the transcription of Meguro Ryoko’s “Boku ni Hikari wo Kurentanda” from Nanabun no Nijyuuni.

# Transcription Notes

Transcribing this piece gave me the same giddy vibes that my transcription of [Oukasuru Wakamono](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71g8zwCsGEY) did.  **A large part of the reason why I enjoy transcribing music is because I feel that I truly gain much more from the experience than from other ways of learning.**  To me, it’s one thing to listen to lectures, or read books, or expose yourself to different kinds of music, or muse around, but it’s a completely different angle to try and write down every note that a recording has (behind all the post processing that blurs it all out).  Not to say that any of those activities are useless, but I do think that this angle of approach tends to inspire me the most, as I feel like I am truly walking through a composer’s writing step by step, note by note.

So on that note (heh), Meguro Ryoko’s string/piano ensemble arrangement of “Boku wa Sonzai Shiteinakatta” was an incredibly conversationally-rich arrangement. In my transcription of Oukasuru Wakamono, I mentioned that that it was really cool that the writer manages to have four unique melodic parts whose sum creates a holistic, multi-dimensional picture that is the piece itself.  This arrangement was no different, but **if the parts in Oukasuru Wakamono were like childhood friends living separate lives keeping in touch occasionally, Boku ni Hikari wo Kuretanda would be like the parent that always checks on their adult children to make sure they’re not dead just quite yet.**  The number of actions-per-minute (APMs!) is just on another level, lol.

So here’s an example of that weaving dance.  Both the piano and strings constantly doubles the main melody for emphasis, only to deviate quickly into its own countermelody as they please:

    <figcaption><i>Figure 2: Viola and Cello 1 Bouncing Rhythmically In and Out of the Melodic Center</i></figcaption>
</figure> 

Annnd the speed dating dancing continues in the parts inability to stay committed to a consistent interval in their harmonizing:

    <figcaption><i>Figure 4: Violin 1 and Violin 2 Changing Intervals in the Harmony (Color Coded)</i></figcaption>
</figure> 

Of course, if you know me, you’ll know that I mean no ill will when I call the instruments speed daters without commitment.  I love to paint great things in terrible light, and this is another one of those days, lol.  Anyway, it goes without saying that the writer uses specific intervals to evoke certain emotions.  Often times in my own arrangements, I default to placing consistent, brain-dead intervals between two parts of a harmony simply because it is easy and safe.  It is quite a treat for me to see arrangements like these use the interval distances so intentionally and frequently to make so many small statements.  It would take a decent amount of time for me to imbue that much meaning into my harmonies like they do, but **I’m sure they have put hours and hours of hard work into priming themselves into a position where these harmonies come much quicker to them than me, so it really is quite the humbling and encouraging spectacle.**

# Recording Notes

Now, I realize that I don’t really talk too much about the recording and editing process, but since this project was pretty much a transcription, I figure I would take the opportunity to babble a bit on the tech-y side of the recording process.

If you watch the video, you will notice that I have two microphones set up.  One is a DPA d:vote 4099 that I primarily use for stage playing, and the other is a Shure KSM32 that I primarily use for studio recording.

<figure class="align-center">
    <img src="/images/2020/06/09/fig-5-microphone-setup-for-violin-viola-shure-ksm32-on-top-dpa-dvote-4099-on-bottom.png" alt="">
    <figcaption><i>Figure 5: Microphone Setup for Violin/Viola (Shure KSM32 on Top, DPA d:vote 4099 on Bottom)</i></figcaption>
</figure> 

The DPA microphone is great for live stage use.  Because of its close proximity to the instrument, the signal-to-noise ratio is great (a.k.a. ratio of your lovely sound vs. your struggling band mates).  It is discrete and unintrusive, which makes both the AV technicians and the musicians happy.  Additionally, when the sound is projected through loudspeakers, the sound has the ability to mellow out and develop on its journey to a person’s ear.  With this application, everyone is basically happy, which is great.

However, if you use the DPA for studio recordings, it does have its shortcomings.  The dry sound that the mic delivers as a result of close proximity may be great for certain pieces, but for an instrument that was never designed to be electronically amplified, the violin generally does not play well with super close-miking techniques in the studio.  **You can gain back some of the tonal complexity by moving the microphone farther away, but the trade off would be that your recording will begin to suffer the consequences of the proximity effect.**  That might be desired in certain pieces, but not for the ones I want, at least.  I find a close sound to be beautifully intimate, and I feel like the farther a sound is, the more it becomes more like a time-share presentation.  But you know, to each their own.  Some people do find time-shares to be worthwhile after all.

Anyway, **string instruments actually rely heavily on the room that they play in to deliver the sound they want to deliver.**  Half of why a string instrument is so resonate is because the sound bounces back and forth between walls to fill a room.  So if you have a great room, you have a happy musician, and a happy AV technician.  Unfortunately, my room is not skillfully acoustically treated, so I must make do with what I have.

So, to recap, in order to avoid everyone hearing the dimensions of my room, I use the DPA microphone to give me a sound that does not demonstrate the proximity effect.  Unfortunately, the shortcoming of such a mic is that I will get a dry tone that loses a fair amount of the natural overtones violins carry.  To capture those back (and to wetten the sound), I use the KSM32 in tandem with the DPA.  **The KSM32 is essentially there to pick up what the DPA couldn’t, and the sum of the two microphones has always provided me with a tone that am generally ok with.**

So, now you know why I have two microphones set up all the time.  Did you like the violin tone this time around?  No?  Great, me too.  **What actually happened this time around was that my KSM32 was acting up, and so the captured audio from that microphone was essentially tossed out.**  This recording actually only uses the DPA microphone, and you can generally hear/feel the lack of a full body in the violin/viola parts, as well as the honky sound that comes from trying to recover some of the lost overtones.  Did I just spend a whole section talking about something that isn’t actually in the recording?  Why yes, yes I did.  :D  Moving on…

# Editing Notes

If you have ever worked with me on a music project, you would quickly figure out that I am usually sorta a purist when it comes to music in the genre of Boku ni Hikari wo Kurentanda.  **I believe that the greatest musician can sound phenomenal on any sort of recording rig (yes, even that flip phone that you may or may not still have), and it is from this belief that I believe that honing your musical craft should be first and foremost, while the AV technology should follow as a support.**  This is the reason why most of my recordings generally refrain from aggressive rhythm flexing and pitch tuning, because a part of me believes that the organic sound is the best representation of the musician.  To be a doctor and dissect the recording on a surgical table would be equivalent to giving birth to a monster (like Frankenstein).

Recently though, I have been placed into a position to reconsider that.  During the past two months, I have been privileged to be able to support the worship ministry at my church in helping them create remote worship recordings.  In the past, my personal projects only needed to consider five or less musicians.  With that number, it wasn’t too difficult to slip by without correcting peoples shortcomings.  Half the time I play most of the parts my self as well, so I usually don’t have much of a problem (as I can hold myself accountable).

But the worship team at FCBC is not Hillsong (for the better or worse).  They have day jobs, children to tend to, lives to tackle, etc.  Creating the cleanest sound is not their priority (and it really shouldn’t be).  So when you throw a 10-12 track recording together with the culmination of potato quality video and audio, well, let’s just say the result can be very, very discouraging to both the musicians and the listeners.

**But not everyone needs a dose of humble pill, so as a dude behind the AV label, I did take liberties with the audio edits to keep people in relative tune, and in rhythm.**  The result is that it is yeah, the Frankenstein that I mentioned before.  But hey, the church is encouraged, and those who participated in remote worship recording that week is encouraged.  Everyone can be happy and enjoy the weight and heart of the music together.  I thought, “well, is that not better than sticking to my guns and insisting that do-ers of music face their shortcomings head on and git better?”  I operate in this manner, but not everyone needs that, especially it will become a place of discouragement.

And so, for this recording, I took that thought and took more liberties than I normally would for my own projects.  **To start, I did a fair amount of volume automation to elevate the dynamic changes in the piece, both on a single instrument level and on a collective group level:**

<figure class="align-center">
    <img src="/images/2020/06/09/fig-6-janky-volume-automation-practices.png" alt="">
    <figcaption><i>Figure 6: Janky Volume Automation Practices</i></figcaption>
</figure> 


**I also made sure to flex the rhythm of the strings a little bit so that they stay in unison:**

<figure class="align-center">
    <img src="/images/2020/06/09/fig-7-rhythm-flexing-to-keep-everyone-in-time.png" alt="">
    <figcaption><i>Figure 7: Rhythm Flexing to Keep Everyone in Time</i></figcaption>
</figure> 

Though, I must note right now, the amount of rhythm flexing is significantly less than whatever I usually need to do. The three of us are three peas in a pod when it comes to music making, and so we generally vibe well with each other in phrasing and timing, so that makes my life a lot easier.

**And lastly, I made sure to tend to keeping everyone in pitch:**

<figure class="align-center">
    <img src="/images/2020/06/09/fig-8-pitch-corrections-minus-violin-1.png" alt="">
    <figcaption><i>Figure 8: Pitch Corrections Minus Violin 1</i></figcaption>
</figure> 

One common issue that I always have when it comes to pitch correction is that blipping and crackling in the audio tends to come up when pitch correction is enabled.  It is something that I have yet to learn how to deal with.  **And in this case, the blipping and crackling comes up in a relatively significant part of the piece in the violin 1 part, and so I actually disabled pitch correction in violin 1.**  So, if you wonder why violin 1 is slightly pitchier than the other parts in the recording….now you know :D

# Concluding Remarks

Music is one of those fields of life where you are endlessly rewarded if you cling to a spirit of curiosity, diligence, inspiration, and experimentation.  I was indeed inspired and intrigued by Meguro Ryoko’s string/piano arrangement of “Boku ni Hikari wo Kuretanda,” and so I spent my recent weekend breaking it down and recording it.  In this process, **I feel that I have gained a little more insight on how the elite writers handle thoughts and ideas, while simultaneously challenging and re-framing the stances that I take in regards to musical integrity.**  At the end of the day, I find that it is these insights that inspires me to keep on Pusheen through different music projects.  While the final video is quite fun to finally publish and immortalize on the Internet, I really do think the true value of the project really is in the insights you gain along the way.  

Welp, as mentioned earlier, I have a fair amount of free time incoming, so hopefully y’all will get to see some more frequent posts (and hopefully by consequence, shorter ones…)!  Look forward to it!
