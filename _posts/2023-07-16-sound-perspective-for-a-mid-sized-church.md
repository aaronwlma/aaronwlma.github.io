excerpt: "Three mantras to guide you in your adventures toward bettering the worship experience in a mid-sized church."
---

If you attend a church with anything between 100 to 1000 attendees, chances are, your church is using amplified sound for its worship service.  If you attend a church with an AV team comprised of volunteers, chances are, your church struggles to produce a consistent house mix that satisfies everyone.  If you attend a church post-COVID, chances are, recordings (whether livestreams or worship tapes) have lit your worship team's interest in making the house mix better.

Striving for excellence is good.  After all, who *doesn't* want a better worship experience?  There is nothing inherently wrong with that goal and direction.  However, before the worship ministries collectively embark on that journey to improve, it is important for the ministries to visit home to lock in what success looks like and what it will cost to get there.  **A shaky foundation to build upon and a hazy vision to pursue will inevitably lead a worship ministry to end up mistaking motion for progress.** 

# The Status Quo
And so, let's start with the foundation.  Back to the first paragraph, if you are attending a mid-sized church, chances are, your church uses amplified sound.  This is important, because without amplified sound, it is a rather difficult task to conduct a weekly Sunday service without destroying the vocal chords of pastors and singers alike.  It is specifically because of this that AV teams are formed.  **AV ministries fundamentally exist to amplify the Sunday stage.**

There can be many, many things wrong behind-the-scenes, but the core task that AV teams must fulfill from Sunday to Sunday is getting that tiny sound on stage to be a big sound.  This is the foundation, and this is 90% of AV's job.  Let's dial in on that a little more.

### The 90%
The Sunday service workflow for many AV teams at mid-sized churches is usually pretty straightforward:
1. **Setup** (plug everything into your soundboard, including instruments, mics, speakers, and monitors)
2. **Line Check** (verify that signals are coming in where they expect, and going out to where they expect)
3. **Gain Stage** (set faders and baseline the gain values on the mixer to provide sufficient headroom for both music and AV teams)
4. **Sound Check** (make the sound in the house pretty)
5. **Run Service** (throw faders and mute/unmute things in a timely manner during the service)
6. **Teardown** (unplug everything and put things back they way they first were)

Five out of the six (1-3, 5-6) are quite straight-forward and quite teachable.  It is relatively simple to ramp someone up on how to setup/teardown (plug/unplug things here and there), how to line check (do you see green bars and hear things), how to gain stage (is it loud enough), and how to run the Sunday service (press unmute when the pastor walks up).  This is traditionally why AV teams, when looking for help, will advertise with the phrase, "no experience required."

And for the most part, this is correct.  The majority of the work can be taught, and anyone can quickly go from zero-to-hero in a few months.  Even better, it offers a win-win situation where the AV ministry can get the help they need while simultaneously offering church members with no experience an opportunity to serve.

If an AV team has a team of members that can execute on these five things, and a streamlined process to onboard new members to execute on these five things, they are already 90% of the way there to excellence.  This is a great score--it is a passing grade.  **Executing on this 90% is the fundamental, uncompromisable need that a mid-sized church asks from its AV team.**

### The 10%
The remaining 10% is the cherry-on-top:  sound check.  This involves making the resulting amplified sound "pretty."  This is something that everyone will nod their heads in agreement on as something that is good and should be done; we all like pretty things after all.  But when its time to let the rubber hit the road and drive off toward that better tomorrow, suddenly it becomes very apparent that not everyone has the same idea of where the destination is.  This is why this 10% will very often lend its way to be the subject of heated discussion at many mid-sized churches that aim to add the cherry.

To make matters potentially worse, tackling the 10% often happens before the locking down the 90%, and AV teams end up constantly plugging holes in a ship that is ever doomed to eventually sink.  Over-zealous EQs lend its way to an errant feedback loop, over-doctored signals lend its way to a disingenuous representation of the music, and, eventually, over-enthusiastic individuals lend their way to unintentionally burning out other members of the ministry.

Unlike the 90%, the 10% is not something that can be taught in just a few months.  **The 10% requires members to learn both logical technicalities and illogical musicality.**  The 10% *also* requires other members to *teach* both logical technicalities and illogical musicality *well*.  And so, with those high bars, the 10% can very well take years and decades to reach a point where the ministry is *kiinda* satisfied with their resulting mix.  Learning the 90%, at best, is only just halfway point when it comes to mastery of producing a good worship mix.  The remaining 10% is a behemoth of a task in itself.

This is why it is good to refer to sound check as the 10% for a mid-sized church with an AV team comprised of volunteers.  **It is not the fundamental need of a church of this size, and it is not the fundamental expectation of a "no experienced required" ministry.**  It is a practice that requires experience, and it is a practice that requires willingness to create space to develop experience.

However, if and when a worship ministry is ready (and willing), **a healthy approach to fulfilling the 10% is noticeable and undeniably elevates the worship experience.**  Diligent, scalable, and sustainable efforts to address the 10% is what takes a mid-sized church's worship experience to the next level.  It truly is the cherry-on-top that rounds out the ice cream sundae (service).

# The Mantras
With that said, the 10% is built on a solid 90%, and the 90% is very often overlooked.  **To help folks retain a healthy mindset in their journey to take the church's worship experience to the next level, I've prepared three mantras that I typically use to keep my expectations in check**, and to stay laser-focused on what success means.  Hopefully, they may be useful to you as well.

### "You know you are doing a good job when nobody notices you"
Most AV teams are pretty familiar with this one.  When the folks behind the PowerPoint are late to flip a slide, or when the folks behind the soundboard are late to unmute an important mic, heads turn.  The PowerPoint or soundboard folk then feels the judgment of 500+ individuals as they let the adrenaline rush through their veins, and that is when we truly know what "Jesus take the wheel" means, because our bodies just move to solve the problem, somehow.  This is generally the kind of scenario that folks think to avoid when they hear "you know you are doing a good job when nobody notices you."

But that is really only just half of what this phrase means.  If you manage to operate in this manner where the congregation does not notice your efforts, then you've done the 90%.  The remaining 10% is serving in a manner where your own fellow ministry members do not notice you.

Here's a pretty typical walkthrough of what that may look like.  At the church I currently serve at, the AV team gets on-site at 8:15am to set up.  The music team arrives at 8:30am (hopefully).  Assuming that it takes a typical musician 15 minutes to set up, this means they are on standby on stage at 8:45am, hopefully ready to rehearse.

Is everything that they need ready for them by then?  Do you know what what "everything" is?  When they plug their instruments into the snake and put their IEMs in, are you set up and ready to set the levels for their monitors?

In order to be ready, that means your soundboard should be ready for that by the time the musicians are standby.  That means, for my church, you have at least 15 minutes and at most 30 minutes to make sure your soundboard connections are ready to serve the music team.  With that known, operate in a manner that allows the music team to not need to wait on you.  **Operate in a manner that makes other ministry members not even know you were needed.**

There's other ways to serve in this manner.  Are you the first to notice that an instrument is plugged into the wrong line?  Did you notice that some weird settings was saved over from the last service before some poor soul had their ears blasted?  Did you notice that a guitarist's pre-amp is out of batteries before even they did?

When you are always one step ahead of the Sunday service process, you will always be able to make the road smooth for the ones behind you.  When the roads are smooth, your music team can focus on what they are there to do--creating music--to the point they may just forget that you are doing anything at all.  This is the next level of the phrase "you know you are doing a good job when nobody notices you."  Strive to serve and unlock your fellow ministry members in this way to help in taking the worship experience to the next level.

### "The soundboard is a musical instrument"
There's a common phrase that I personally hear wherever I serve on soundboard, and it's "it's so great to have you on soundboard because you have a music background."  It's a phrase with the underlying message that only musicians can generate a "good" mix.  This is only half true, because throwing a musician on soundboard duty without any soundboard experience will still generate a junky mix.  **What the full truth really is, as mentioned in the 10%, is that a "good" mix comes from individuals who have exercised both their musical sense and technical knowledge on the soundboard over and over again.**

I've played the violin for 25 years now.  I was classically trained for 10 years, and I've worked on small gigs and projects after.  I didn't learn to play the violin by reading about the violin, or by watching people play the violin.  I didn't even technically learn from being taught.  I learned by practicing.  Yes, reading, watching, and being taught all gave me pointers on what I needed to do to get better, but the only reason I have the tone, technique, and expression on the violin today is because I did put in those daily 45 minute practices daily as a kid (kinda, you know how kids can be).

Getting good at a musical instrument requires practice, so that you build experience, so that over countless "performances", you develop mastery.  **The soundboard is the same way.**

You can read about what gain/EQ/compression/effects are, you can watch YouTube tutorials of other AV teams showing you how to do things, and you can even have an experienced soundboard individual come and teach you.  But **until you stand behind the board, plug things in, turn some knobs, and throw some faders, you won't *actually* develop any significant experience, and consequently, you won't get any better at the soundboard.**  It doesn't matter how "musical" you are, or how "knowledgeable" you get.  If you don't take the time to create a mix, expose it to the public, critically review it, and then go back and create another mix, then you won't actually get better.

So treat getting to the next level on the soundboard like learning a musical instrument.  You can easily download a free digital workstation (i.e., Reaper), load up some samples, work on your mix, and then export the result and have your trusted individuals provide feedback.  In that process, you will learn where the limitations are, the things you want to do but don't know how, the way sound clutters a soundspace, and many more.  Find some solutions and give them a try.  And then share your results (and get roasted).  And then do it again, and again, and again.  Practice mixing on your own, and that practice will direcly translate over to a better mix on Sunday morning.

### "Worship team is two teams--music and AV"
Call me pedantic, but I personally don't like how churches of the current era call their music teams "worship team."  It implies that it is the team of musicians on stage that bring the worship experience to the congregation.  This is only half of the contribution.  The other half is delivered by the AV team.

While the music team themselves are the creators that handle the providing the input, the AV team themselves are the amplifiers are handle delivering the said input.  Without the input *and* the output, there is no experience.  **Collectively, the music and AV teams create the worship experience,** and that's why I prefer to call "worship team" the "music team."  The are two teams serving as one collaborative.

Now, if it is the case that the worship team is actually two teams comprised of music and AV divisions, there are some implications here that I think are good to point out.

The first is that **the soundboard-ist(?) should view themselves as part of the music band themselves.**  As a violinist on stage, I know what the drummer is there for.  The drummer provides the beat and energy, and I mirror it.  I know when we are building to a high because the drummer will play in a manner to suggest we are building to a high.  I don't know how to play the drums myself, but I know what the drummer is there for.  I also know what the vocalists are there for.  And the guitarists, and the bassists, etc.

In the same way, the soundboard-ist needs to know what the band members are there for.  They need to also be accustomed to picking up the cues and throw their faders in response to that.  If worship team is one team, then the person behind the soundboard should aim to be connected to the stage and its happenings.  Capture the intent of each of your band members, and amplify their expression to let them shine when they intend to.

The second implication of this is that both **music and AV teams must extend mutual trust and respect to each other as if they are fellow band members.**  Again, as a violinist on stage, I do make a fair amount of mistakes.  Awkward keys and muddy direction can take a toll on my ability to play in tune.  I have my own ways of practice to be better at this, but at no point will any of the band members come over mid-set and take my violin to play in my stead.

Instead, there are respectful, contextual ways to work through obstacles like these.  Vocalist misses their cues all the time?  No problem, let me see if I can play in a manner that is more obvious where the downbeat is for the vocalist.  Note is hard to hit for the vocalist?  No problem, I'll double you to give you a pitch reference and to give you confidence.  And when I have exhausted all my options, and the problem is still unbearably bad, no problem, let's have a conversation when all is done and stress of the service day is done.  Let's see what we can do.

The relationship between the one behind the soundboard and the band should be similar.  At no point should anyone reach and play the soundboard in their stead.  If the person behind the soundboard is struggling to pick out the lead line, then musicians should think about how you can play the lead line to make it clearer (if your expression isn't clear to the one actively listening, then would it be clear to the congregation, who isn't focusing on you?).  Exhaust your options, and if the problem is still unbearably bad, no problem, have a conversation when all is done and the stress of the service day is done, and see what we can do.

**When the music team views AV as part of the team, and when AV views music team as part of the team, they will naturally extend their trust, respect, and empathy that they already have for fellow team members across the stage boundary.**  When the music team views AV as part of the team, and when AV views music team as part of the team, then "the work that needs to be done" becomes clear.  Creating a worship experience on the next level is a collaborative task, and viewing the music and AV teams as one collective will generate a sustainable and respectful path towards it.

# Final Thoughts
And so, to sum it all up, conquering the 10% (making the front-of-house mix sound *better*) requires the full attention of the AV team.  Because it requires the full attention, **AV teams should make sure to verify that the 90% (fulfilling the fundamental need of an AV team in a mid-sized church) is solidly in place before looking to tackle the 10%.**  Without solid fundamentals, AV teams quickly devolve into creating more problems than they started and risk cultivating a ministry culture that does not build the community of Christ.

But if an AV team verifies the 90% and believes that it is a good time to tackle the 10%, then the AV team needs to confirm the buy-in of the music team.  **Both teams will need to extend trust, respect, and empathy towards one another and consider each other as one team.**  From that perspective, the work that needs to be done (both relational and technical) will become clear.  **From there, it is just a matter of putting in due diligence to put in the hours and iterations to develop experience.**  If there is that safe space to build experience, then over time, I believe that churches that rely on volunteer members to deliver the worship experience to the congregation will be able to sustainably elevate the experience in a scalable and glorifying manner.

Best of luck!
