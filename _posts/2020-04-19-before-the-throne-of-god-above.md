<hr>

Earlier this year, I wrote that I planned to take a break from worship arrangements and the worship stage for 3 months, yet here I am, 2 months in, writing about an arrangement that I wrote…for worship.

Now, before y’all call me out on my inability to commit a decision I make in my life, I’d like to make an effort to salvage any sort of respect from you for me (if any…:D).  I’d like to point out that shortly after I made the choice to take a break, a uh, pandemic happened, and the circumstances all around the world changed.  **I do believe I did feel that these circumstances ended up presenting an unique and potentially uplifting opportunity to help using the gifts and blessings given to me, and so I mindfully decided that the change was significant enough to change the guidelines surrounding my break.**

Alright, that’s my let-me-explain moment.  Go ahead, make your call.  If y’all don’t vibe with that and think I ought to have stuck to my guns because it sets a precedent and alludes to the inability to be firm with decision, I don’t think you’re wrong at all.  I also don’t think I made a bad decision either.  But who knows, I have no basis to compare.  Only when I reach the pearly gates will I truly know the correctness of my decisions.  Slightly morbid there, but that mentality does drive the courage to be bold at times, so I wanted to share that before I got into the nitty-gritties (which we have a decent amount this time!).  It comes from a nice book that I read way back in the good ‘ol high school days.  If you like philosophy, but hate reading dry books, you can check it out, it’s “[The Unbearable Lightness of Being](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Unbearable_Lightness_of_Being)” by Milan Kundera.  Here’s also the quote that I am alluding to, for all y’all who like quotes:

> “We can never know what to want, because, living only one life, we can neither compare it with our previous lives nor perfect it in our lives to come....There is no means in testing which decision is better, because there is no basis for comparison.”
>
> <cite class="align-right">--Milan Kundera, from "The Unbearable Lightness of Being"</cite>

Alright, the usual ritual has been performed and the stage is now set.  Tangential thoughts out, music shenanigans in.  Go, go!

# Admiration for the Musicians Beyond Me

There are a BUNCH of incredible musicians out there on the Internet.  And for good reason, they poured sweat and blood (figuratively, I hope) out into tirelessly improving their craft to best express what dwells in their hearts and souls.  Respect that, admire that, capture that…and chuck it in your arrangement if you think their message translates into what you’re looking to express.  :D

Here’s one to look at:

<figure class="align-center">
    <img src="/images/2020/04/19/figure-1-glissandos-in-the-viola-and-cello-as-a-transition-from-interlude-to-verse.png" alt="">
    <figcaption><i>Figure 1: Glissandos in the Viola and Cello as a Transition from Interlude to Verse</i></figcaption>
</figure>

In ear-comprehendable terms:

    </audio>
    <figcaption><i>Excerpt 1: Glissandos Inspired by King's Kaleidoscope</i></figcaption>
</figure>

Now, I know the MIDI render sounds absolutely abysmal, and I noticed that Alvin didn’t even notice the notation (how dare he…), but the glissando written at the end of this interlude was in imitation of the style [commonly found in King’s Kaleidoscope’s music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4FBLH5n6IU&t=11s).  I find that glissandos like this between two adjacent notes of a cadence really emphasizes that cathartic release of tension that cadences typically give.  To me, that emphasized release of tension can be distracting if used improperly, so do use it sparingly, and probably not the best idea to use it in-between phrases if it’s for worship…

Here’s another one:

<figure class="align-center">

    <figcaption><i>Figure 2: The Phrase Contour in the Counter-Melody in Verse 3</i></figcaption>
</figure>

Annd in ear-friendly terms:

    </audio>
    <figcaption><i>Excerpt 2: Adapted Phrase Contour from Weathering With You</i></figcaption>
</figure>

The **inspiration from this one actually came from an arrangement of a Weathering With You medley that I have already written** (but we haven’t recorded due to social distancing :( ).  Specifically, [from a segment in Fireworks Festival by RADWIMPS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDR1DFtik0E&t=141s).  The cello line in measure 44 is inspired by 2:21, and the violin line in measure 45 is inspired by 2:36.  Granted, the notes and rhythms are not particularly the same, but it was the contour of the phrases that I was aiming to replicate.  In this case, I was aiming for the cello to pose an unstable/uncentered rhythmic landing to lead into an even more unstable F# in a D major chord that ends on the tonic.  So, similarly, I wanted that tension into a cathartic release, like what I aimed to do with the glissandos.

Lastly, here’s a blip in the cello melodic line:

<figure class="align-center">

</figure>

For your ear-joyment:

    </audio>
    <figcaption><i>Excerpt 3: Sneaking in "I Will Glory in My Redeemer"</i></figcaption>
</figure>

For all y’all Christian-culturely educated, do you hear what it sounds like?  If you guessed that **it sounds very similar to “I Will Glory in My Redeemer,” specifically** **[this part](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CR4wRqL0Cn0&t=29s)**, great job, your memory serves you well.  If you let your eyes drift a little down toward the little letters above the melody line (waow, what are those?!) in Figure 3, you’ll notice that the chords go G-A-Bm-G.  I always loved it when chords move incrementally up.  It creates a whole bunch of suspense that looks for some sort of resolution (man that’s all I’ve been saying today huh).

There’s a whole bunch of ways to approach a rising chord, but as bit of a side note, I just wanted to share with you [a track that’s always in my head whenever I hear a rising chord](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prBrwHMaU1s&t=4308s).  For time stamps, 1:12:11 and 1:12:42 are two distinct moments.  Totally not related, but enjoy!

# Admiration for the Musicians Around Me

Now, if you thinkin’, “Aaron, it’s not just that cello blip that sounds familar, I think heard this arrangement before.”  Guess what?  You’re probably right.  Not only is this arrangement just a retrofit of the arrangement that I wrote for praise night at FCBC in December 2019, **the arrangement framework was actually heavily inspired by** **[the arrangement of “In the Cross Alone I Glory” written by my good friend Matthew Tong](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zNdWXkGYcck)**.

Earlier last year, I mentioned that Matthew’s slow spamming of articulated notes in “Surely Goodness, Surely Mercy” was an eye opening experience, and this was also indeed the case with his arrangement of “In the Cross Alone I Glory.”  His arrangement showed to me that you don’t necessarily need to transition using leading notes or rhythms.  **You, as the writer, can demand things at the switch of the flip.**

<figure class="align-center">
    <img src="/images/2020/04/19/figure-4-the-source-of-mimicry-in-matthews-in-the-cross-alone-i-glory.png" alt="">

    </audio>
    <figcaption><i>Excerpt 4: Matt's Color Change in In the Cross Alone I Glory</i></figcaption>
</figure>

So, I did the same, copying that dime-flipping, and even using a very similar rhythmic pattern.   That rhythmic pattern ends up being used for all of verse 1 of this arrangement as well.

<figure class="align-center">

    </audio>
    <figcaption><i>Excerpt 5: A Mimicry of Matt in Before the Throne of God Above</i></figcaption>
</figure>

Additionally, as a bonus note, “In the Cross Alone I Glory” spent extra effort to keep the melodic phrases in the interlude from resolving early, which is a tendency I always have because I get afraid of deviating too far from the tonic.  In inspiration of his efforts, I also tried to resist the temptation on always resolving the downbeats of each measure.  I’d like to believe that being aware of this temptation and actively resisting it has opened a few doors of possibilities for me.

There’s also another musician that inspired this arrangement this week, and he plays with us from time to time.  Brian Luck’s piano-ing is always quite fascinating to me, especially because he somehow always find his place to develop his sound in the mix.  I mentioned earlier that glissandos are great for the cathartic release of tension, but if you resolve to nothing-ness, that seems kinda like a waste of tools, no?

    </audio>
    <figcaption><i>Excerpt 6: Imitating Arpeggio's Like Brian</i></figcaption>
</figure>

So what I actually did was have the glissando release its tension into the piano line noted above.  **This arpeggio action was directly inspired by** [**what Brian did in “In the Cross Alone I Glory”**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIoTSAHAEvE&t=36s) (again, lol).  Because the register is high, it doesn’t distract from the melody, despite its rather busy movement.  To me, this kinda sparkle reminds me of little butterflies fluttering around someone as they walk through a park.  Not busy enough to be a bee (busy bee, get it?), but interesting enough for you to feel like it adds a bit of a color to the mix.

Brian and Matthew are quite the imaginative musicians, so I am super thankful that I have the fortune to be able to interact with (and steal from) them.

# Admiration for Myself

Now, I don’t write these notes to toot my horn or anything, they’re just notes to detail how I wrote things, and where I get these from.  At times (more often than not), the arrangements that I write are absolute trash.  But once in a blue moon, I do write things where I say to myself “Wow, I wrote that?  How?  I don’t even know.”  There were things in this arrangement that I ended up surprising myself with, and I think it would be good to point out what I believed those were.

The biggest surprise for me was my delicate use of motifs.  **It’s really easy for a writer to fall into the trap of copying and pasting their best ideas all across an arrangement because they think it sounds cool** (and often also because they can’t think of anything more to add).  What ends up happening a lot of times in that situation is that the idea becomes bland, and a bit tiring actually.  It’s like when I tell my parents I like Milanos, and suddenly they never do a Costco run without restocking the Milano stash.  They’re still delicious an all, but I can’t eat them all the time.  And frankly, its frequency just cheapens what used to be quite the special item.

    </audio>
    <figcaption><i>Excerpt 7: Initial Theme in the Piano</i></figcaption>
</figure>

So this is a motif that I chucked in to start the Milano journey off.  I chucked it into the piano line at measure 36, and **it’s actually kinda a derivation of the arpeggio line inspired by Brian**.  The motif is great at tying together energies between two phrases, and so I also used it here, with bonus harmonies:

The question to ask when recycling ideas like this is whether it added anything intrinsically or not.  Did using that phrase again add anything?  Or do your ears roll their figurative eyes and disregard it?  **You can personally measure the effectiveness of your motif by assessing whether you look forward to hearing that line again**.  I personally looked forward to it each time, so I consider it a decent success, and I honestly have no idea how this idea came to me.  Perhaps it was the power of the music of the night (for all y’all who didn’t watch the one day premiere this weekend of The Phantom of the Opera on The Shows Must Go On! on Youtube, y’all missed out!).

# Concluding Remarks

After a while, all of my arrangement notes start to just start to sound the same to me, but I guess I am a slave to my mind and I have to beat the dead horse.  **I find inspiration from the music that I listen to**.  Sometimes that’s in Christian contemporary, sometimes that’s in anime, sometimes that’s in musicals, and sometimes it could be from a TV commercial.  **I also find inspiration from the musicians I work with**.  Watching my peers approach the same problems that I run into with a chock-full of finesse and creativity always points me to doors of opportunity and possibilities.

**All these sources of inspiration fuel things that I write, and sometimes, that pool of inspiration becomes so saturated that I no longer even recognize where I adapted ideas from**. I end up sitting there thinking “wow, how’d that happen, I impress myself.”  And I do my best to follow up with “yeah, do it again.”  A novice practices their craft until they get it right, but a master practices their craft until they can’t do it wrong.  I like to believe that I did some nice things this time around, but who knows maybe that was just a fluke.  But luckily, this ain’t life, and unlike what Mr. Kundera says, I’ll have more opportunities to try again to test if my decisions in music are the correct ones, so look forward to it!
