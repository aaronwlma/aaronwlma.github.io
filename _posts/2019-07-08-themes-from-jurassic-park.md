Wow, it’s been a while since the last recording note.  I totally didn’t realize how many times I’ve skipped out on one of these recently.  Sorry, my devoted readers (hi mom!).  Lucky for y’all, I’ve made the notes migration from our quartet website domain to my newly redesigned portfolio, so now I can be even more personal with the reflections!

I’ll be real, this one was a rough one, but not in the act of recording.  **It was a difficult piece to sound great.**  For this recording, we added the lovely cellist Kalvin who wanted to give a spin on collaborating with us.  In other words, we went from having 4x3x2x1 possibilities (24 possibilities for all y’all who hate math) to be mistimed to 5x4x3x2x1 (96) possibilities.  That’s quite the exponential increase of require awareness.  Didn’t help also that Jurassic Park is written by the esteemed John Williams, the dude who loves to put rhythm patterns that most classically trained amateur musicians would be uncomfortable with.  All in all, the difficulty of this arrangement by Matthew was screaming “Yo guys, this is gonna be a difficult execution.”

To me, I felt that we did not approach this arrangement with proper effort to take care of its difficulty.  Sufficient individual practice was lacking prior to meeting, and because of the lack of practice there was a lack of attention to phrasing.  **The lack of attention meant that the same phrase was played in the same manner.  Every.  Single.  Time.**  The result is a rather stale repetition of the themes in Jurassic Park over and over again.

So how did this shortcoming translate over in the editing process?  Well, in short, **there was a desperate attempt to create something that didn’t exist, instead of just amplifying what is already there.**  The overall mix required some fat reverb, heavy compression, and aggressive gain adjustments to bleed out some of the shortcomings, and **the result is that the final edit feels almost like a dishonest representation of our performanship and capabilities.**

As usual, these recording notes are not a platform to vent or rant in frustration.  Letting negative thoughts loose should always be complimented with either the saving positive, or the proper course of action.  And so, what’s the personal takeaway for this recording?

Well, I ought to be reminded that these recordings are made for fun.  Not to promote, not to sound great, not to develop or change careers, not to convince people hire us for gigs, not to build identity.  The shortcomings are not insurmountable.  **With diligent practice every week in preparation for a piece that has yet to be written, we can have the skills ready for any sort of arrangement we write.**  With proper role allocation and definitions, we can put people where their strengths are and allow them to develop on their strengths while to minimizing our weaknesses.  There are ways to get better, but it seemingly requires more than what we are willing to invest.  But if I remember that these are made in fun, that the objective of spending 40 man hours to create one piece is so that we can continue to enjoy making music and sharing our favorite pieces from the places that have shaped how we think and act, then I think that I can accept where we as a group have decided to land.

I think the slight increase of the difficulty of execution in Jurassic Park was very telling of what we are willing to invest, and I think seeing that is good as it allows us to remember that we are not professionals.  **We’re just a bunch of friends gathering to enjoy music together, and so there is nothing gained by being frustrated in the lack of forward movement toward bettering ourselves against such shortcomings.**  At the end of the day, being able to collaborate with someone new is a fun experience, and I hope our guest enjoyed music as much as we do!
