excerpt: "Happy birthday to me! This year I turned 28, and to celebrate (or mourn?) the coming of a new year, I did a cover of Tim Be Told’s 28 with Matt Tong. This is also marks the re-launch of my personal music channel, and in this production note, I detail why exactly I recorded this cover in this fashion."

Man, something I am learning time and time again is that the words of wisdom from the old are wise.  Yeah, I know, no way, right?  But it’s true, it’s crazy.  Every time the old folk drops a wisdom bomb on me, I jump and twirl like how Neo dodges a bullet (sunglasses, panning slo-mo, and all that jazz), totally convinced that it won’t hit me.  But of course, ‘tis a bomb, not a bullet.  And so, the wisdom explodes in all its wondrous glory…and takes my life and mind with it.  As I lay there dying, I think about stupid I am, and think about how in the world did I think dodging a bomb would be a good idea.  And I conclude that I’ll definitely remember that the next time a wisdom bomb is chucked at me.  Of course though, in true Aaron fashion, the next time it happens, I rinse and repeat this process.

Guys, after a while, the age really does just creep up on you man.  I still think I just recently graduated college, but the reality is that I’ve actually been gone from UC Irvine for longer than I’ve actually studied there now.  The older you get, the quicker the years seem to go by.  Gotta definitely look to the future, but don’t forget to cherish the present too.  You only get one shot (and it’s your best one).

So, it’s really strange to revisit this song by Tim Be Told, because when “28” first came out, I had just turned 21 four days earlier (Do listen to the original [here](https://timbetold.bandcamp.com/track/28) by the way!  It’s really nice).  Which, was totally awesome as that age is where the song conveniently starts (“20 was so simple with my pocket of dreams”).  And 8 years later, here I am, at the end of the 2 minute and 45 second song (“Hello 28, puh-lease be a better year”).  It felt just like last year that I discovered this song, wondering if I would be singing the same song as Tim when I turned 28, and before I could even reflect on that, I’m here, singing that same song.

Anyway, before I get into the music nitty-gritties, Let’s take a roadtrip down memory lane:

This is a chat log between and Matthew when we first heard 28 back in the good ol’ college days in 2013.  I was studying abroad in Hong Kong while totally being productive at the ungodly hour of 1:15am.  As far as I can remember, music has been an integral part of both Matthew’s life and my life.  But, it seems that wasn’t always the case, because apparently, buying the latest Samsung phone and making bad puns were more important to us than the intricacies of the musical art.  This actually has nothing to do with what I want to say this time around, but I was amused to dig this up, so I figured perhaps y’all would be amused too.

Oh yeah, if you’re also wondering.  I didn’t end up contributing.  Sorry, Tim.  :/

Alright, I’ve satisfied my urge to tangent.  Let’s get in to actual music stuff now.  I tend to ramble way too often, and as much as I am amused when I look back at my notes, today is a day where I actually want to try and keep it short.  So here we go…

# Why I Did What I Did #1: X-Y Mic Orientation w/ Backup Ambiance Condenser Mic

In my more well-known recordings, I’ve always opted to use close miking to mic up my musicians.  But to be honest, I actually prefer this way of miking (a pair of condensers in X-Y orientation) up a lot more.  **A room is also an instrument.**  Close miking allows for easier control over an individual’s intonation and dynamic, but a lot of overtones get lost recording when gain staging for a high dynamic range.

Moving the mic farther back not only allows for those overtones to flourish, but also allow for the sounds that reflect off the walls to also be captured.  **By miking with an X-Y orientation, I feel like I am better able to capture the musical interaction as whole.**  With the sounds of the instruments propagating through air and running into walls, furniture, high ceilings and each other, back and forth, back and forth, I feel like recording from a listener’s position is the best way to experience acoustic, live recordings.

# Why I Did What I Did #2: Publishing the Take with the Most Mistakes

From a note accuracy perspective, this published take, take 3/5, is actually my worst take.  I forgot what came next at 0:31, I play the wrong line at 0:51, intonation was always shaky on the 1:15 theme, etc., etc., etc.  The list can go on and on and on.

But between all the takes that I did, this was the one that made me smile the most.  Take 2/5 was actually good from an accuracy perspective, but in that take, I was very focused on the sheet music 5 feet away from me.  Since that take was satisfactory, I figured I could have a little more fun with the remaining takes, and so I tried my best to play from memory.

I love playing from memory.  **When you detach yourself from sheet music, you naturally start moving and looking at the things you deem important to look at and move to.**  Your eyes slowly turn off, and suddenly your accompaniment’s musical intentions become clearer, you become more aware of what your fingers are doing, and you sometimes can think about what you want to say 5-6-7-8 measures down the line.

For me, I hear and see more of what I love about music in the take where I detach myself from the sheet music.  Yes, there are tons more mistakes, because I forget the music, or the planned bowings and fingerings.  But with one giggle and acknowledgement of my mistake I move on and continue to focus on what means the most to me at that moment:  Say what I want to say with the music that I play, and don’t worry if it’s not what everyone wants to hear.

# Why I Did What I Did #3: One Shot Single Camera

Having cuts are great.  You get to help the viewers and listeners see specifically what you want them to hear, you keep their interest fresh, and you can do some pretty cool transitions and timings to amplify the experience.

What I don’t like about cuts in these sorts of recordings, though, is precisely all that.  I don’t like a doctored experience.  I don’t need you to give me a close up shot of Matthew’s hands to tell me that he’s playing the solo, or to switch the cut over to me when I play a counter to Matthew’s main melody.  I like to see and hear the whole musical experience, like a dude, sitting a few feet away.  And so, for my recording, I left it with one camera angle, as if you were standing a few feet in front of us, just watching the two of us interact, both with our physical movement, and the sound that we project.

This, of course, may change if my pay check goes up.  I try to be all artsy fartsy with my reasoning, but let’s be real, if suddenly 5 Sony A7sII cameras magically appeared in front of me, I’d definitely be considering a new artistic bogus reason to justify cuts.  What is artistic integrity anyway?  :D I’m obviously joking, but I do believe that my opinions on this are pretty open.  So if you believe elsewise and would like to chat, hit me up!

# Conclusive Remarks

With my first recording in my new age, I did my best to present what I stand behind when it comes to the approach to music.  In an age of filled with a plethora of information, I’ve learned that expression, experience, and intent become increasingly valuable, as those are uniquely yours and no one else’s.  So with this cover of Tim Be Told’s “28,” I aimed to best present just that.  **The recording isn’t to present the best of me, it is to present myself as I am now, and where I aim to be.**  And, as always, I hope that my lifelong struggles and experiments to explore my musical interests are of good entertainment and encouragement to you!  There’s more exploratory content planned, so look forward to it!
