<hr>

So today was the fourth time I’ve been asked to help out with worship at FCBC Walnut since re-committing to service at this church.  I figure if they asked four times already, then the things I’m doing are not entirely bad.  That, and I figured I ought to write experience notes to make sure I remember the things I learned along the way (both good and bad).  So welcome!  To the first installation of my worship debrief.

The two songs that I assumed the task of arranging music for was Tommy Walker’s “My Jesus, I Love Thee” and MercyMe’s version of “The Love of God.”  I say assumed, because most worship leaders don’t expect full-on written music for their worship set.  I also say assumed, because I basically took the implied task from Matthew.  But more on those ideas later.  I’m pretty excited, so let’s just break down “My Jesus, I Love Thee.”  I’ll break down “The Love of God” in a later post, maybe.

# Case 1: American Cowboys in the Chinese Church

So right off the bat we had an interesting one.  The first thing I noticed about this version of “My Jesus, I Love Thee,” were the cornfields and hay stacks oozing out from its approach.  First, “ah, fiddle tunes.”  Second, “ah, crap.”  **This was the first time I was going to work with the worship leader Victor for worship, so I had no idea whether or not his intention for sending us this link was to show us “hey, we’re gonna play some yeehaws this week” or to say “this is the song we’re doing.”**  Either I had to ask a bunch of questions to Victor personally, or I could make a reasonable arrangement that could be adaptable in both possibilities.  Usually the answer the question of his intent is somewhere in between in these situations, so I opted for the latter in attempting to arrange something that was adaptable, and I’d like to believe that it worked out.

So more on my approach to fiddle tunes.  I personally don’t have too much of a problem with fiddle ideas in an arrangement for a Chinese family church, but I am also painfully aware of the amount of attention that kind of style draws.  Coupling that with the innate attention that violin naturally grabs when it enters a worship stage, **I took special effort in writing in a manner that encouraged the worship team to keep the country groove, while staying tame enough to not be a distraction to the congregation.**

</figure>

So let’s take a look at case 1 of this arrangement.  This is the opening line for violin 1, entering for verse 2.  In Victor’s approach to this song, this opening line is what basically said “yeehaw my peng yous.”  The intro and verse 1 were relatively in a standard worship style.  Originally, our bassist Caroline tried to start verse 1 with the country vibe, but the forwardness of such a bass line caused our supporting singer Leslie to leave the room momentarily because she could not stop laughing.  So, the proposal (and what we ended up doing) was to start the country vibes when the violin started it at verse 2, so that it was less in your face.

Great, I’m making a statement.

Normally, if it’s just violin, this statement I think is relatively aggressive, and often out of place.  But I placed my trust in our pianist Matthew, and as always, he met and exceeded my expectations.  Here’s a janky excerpt from our rehearsal demonstrating that:

I believe that if Matthew played block chords on the violin entry, then yeah, the violin would be painfully forward.  **Fortunately, because of the style he chose, and the high pitched fills during my long notes, I felt like my aggressive statement to throw some lassos was properly followed up and supported by the piano.**  Personally, I felt that Matthew’s support in this arrangement was the X-factor that (potentially?) eased the congregation into accepting this country style.

# Case 2: Runs Like the Wind Bullseye(?!)

<figure class="align-center">

    <figcaption><i>Figure 2: Runs in Between Verses for Both Violins</i></figcaption>
</figure>

Here’s another line I’d like to point out as something new. What’s happening here is that I have violin 1 and violin 2 running down a scale together, with a 3rds interval between the two of them. I normally don’t do something like this, because again, I considered runs to be a relatively aggressive statement. But, this time, I decided to go with it. This was in response to my feelings from my last arrangement with worship leader Aaron.  I actively avoided rhythms faster than 8th notes, because I generally thought that anything faster than that was an aggressive statement, and that it would require the musicians to be already well practiced.  After review, I found that avoiding rhythmically fast elements was that, the string was basically a string pad.  There are pros and cons of mashing chords together as a string group, but **when you mash chords all the time, well, strings end up being ambient sounds that really don’t accomplish what strings have a strong capability of doing, which is amplifying/supplementing/supporting the band.**

So I threw it in, and my personal verdict was that I liked it!  I was a little concerned that because of it’s quickness, I would stress and struggle on stage to play them, but no, they ended up being relatively easy to play, even on sightread.  Thank you, regular practice, you served me well today.  Actually, probably the biggest problem I was having with the runs is that I tried to fit everything on one page so that I don’t need to flip pages while playing, so the notes were a little too small to read quickly.  Might be time to invest in a page turner…or a build my $10 one.

Oh, everything isn’t without pros and cons though.  There was a danger and point of slight stress in doing these runs.  These runs rely on the worship team having a consistent pattern in breaks.  There were a few times where Victor would come in a bar early in one practice run, and then come a bar later in another practice run.  Slightly nerve wracking to not know if you’re going to be able to stick the landing with them.  Because, let’s be real, even **if the worship leader comes in a bar early, and you don’t end the run when they start, you’re the one who looks dumb.**

But I personally think in these kinds of situation is where you really got to rile yourself up in confidence.  Play with such assertion and confidence that everyone on the team notices your statement.  It’s like driving up and saying “no time to waste!  Get in the car!”  When you make that statement to your team, before your teammates are even aware, they will follow.  I think there’s a natural tendency when it comes to playing on a worship stage for violinists to shy away from everything.  Shy away from hard things, shy away from playing as they normally do, shy away from doing anything bold, etc.  **In the end, I believe that violinists should just trust in their teammates, both on stage and in the sound booth, and just make the runs for it with full confidence.**

# Case 3: Help You Help Me Help You...

In this arrangement of “My Jesus, I Love Thee,” Victor wanted to have verse 4 drop out with strings only and congregation singing.  He wanted this to persist until the second part of the verse, where they would build back in and restore the country vibes.  Great, sounds like a beautiful break from the hard 1-3 count that we get from playing in a country style.

Uh, problems, though.  Do we drop the tempo when we enter verse 4?  What if the congregation does its natural tendency to slow down?  Looks like you’re singing once in a while too in your mic, are you going to do that too?  What’s your landing point sound like, so that I can construct and set the stage up for you to come back in?  All of these questions led to a very muddy intent during this verse 4.  **I had lots of questions with this part, and I made a personal mistake.  I didn’t ask.**  I did what I did in case 1, that is, I exercised some intuition and felt like it was sufficient to feel out the team to figure out what they wanted.

So what did I do, then, to try and clear up the muddy intent?  I changed the violin 2 part and cello parts to mash quarter notes to keep the rhythm pulse going from the interlude.

<figure class="align-center">
    <img src="/images/2019/09/02/figure-3-attempting-to-support-the-congregation-only-verse-with-pulsing-quarter-notes.png" alt="">
    <figcaption><i>Figure 3: Attempting to Support the Congregation-Only Verse with Pulsing Quarter Notes</i></figcaption>
</figure>

I believed the pulse would be enough to guide the congregation in staying on beat, as well as give Victor and the team the ability to catch the tempo.  Mashing quarter notes like this is like a patch fix, yeah, I know.  I was a little bit lazy with it because I couldn’t really find the vibe I was going for from the get go, and so I slightly gave up on it, especially since I was concerned, again, about being too forward with the strings.

So I wrote a solution in reflection to our practice, but it still didn’t work out.  Why?  Two major reasons worth noting:  The first is that I designated V2 and cello to hold the pulse on their own.  The second is that the team was looking to us to guide.

The first was bad, because after the drop out (demonstrated in the excerpt below), it requires immense confidence to play out the pulse note when you’re no longer blending in with the band.  I found that throwing violin 2 on that solo duty of leading the charge initially was asking a lot.  That and, well, it seems like the pulse doesn’t make very much musical sense anyway.

The second was bad, because when Victor passed the ball to us to guide, we wanted to follow.  I placed hold notes until I heard the entrance of the next line start, and then the violins would respond.  It sounds fine, if the strings are following.  But that isn’t the case here.  The strings are leading.  And as leaders, we were asking our employees to go forward and we would support them, when, really, the team and the congregation was looking for a leader to say “pick up your cross, die to yourself, and follow me.”  Well, not all of that, but mostly the follow me part.

I could have solved the first portion of my problem relatively easily by writing in a better manner that didn’t ask too much from the musicians, but what about the second portion?  Would should I have done?  This is where I believe I made a mistake, I should have asked.  All the questions that I had in the first paragraph of this case, I should have just asked.  I believe if I had just asked, then I would have been able to grasp the intent, and realize sooner that I should not have written in a following manner during this portion.  **So, as much as my intuition usually serves me well, this time around, internalizing everything and thinking that I could solve a problem without raising a concern was overly ambitious of me.**  Lesson learned for next time, hopefully!

# Concluding Remarks

Overall, I found this worship piece to be pretty fun to play (as is with many things in my life that involve music).  As I mentioned before, **my primary goal in this arrangement was to amplify the country vibes in this piece, without being too forward with the strings.**  Among other things, to accomplish this goal, I consciously threw in some country fiddling style interludes, threw in some 1-3 rhythms in the cello, used bolder ideas to play during held notes, and used runs liberally to fill the empty spaces in the band.

I mentioned that this was my first time doing worship with Victor at FCBC earlier on, and I’m happy to say that it was a pleasant experience!  His song choices were aligned well with the sermon topic, and he was very conscious of the fact that, as musicians, we love and enjoy playing music, but **he was also very conscious of the fact that, as a worship team, we are to focus on bringing the congregation before the Lord, undistracted, and with whole heart.**  There is always a delicate balance in approaching that mission, so I appreciated his mini-message on the Church of Ephesus on how fixated they became on doing works for the Lord (as mentioned in the book of Revelations) and have lost their first love for the Lord in their trials and toils.  Having a leader remind his team to return to a proper heart of worship is always respected and appreciated.
