It took less time than I thought it would take, but **Heion Naru Hibi from Hibike! Euphonium’s 2nd season OST is finished!**  Woohoo!  

This was a one-to-one transcription from the OST for Cello and Piano, and it turned out to be a lot simpler than I thought it out to be.  The song uses relatively simple chords at times (e.g. opting for an arpeggio on 1-3-5) as well as relatively predictable movement (e.g. generous use of leading notes).  The hardest part about the transcription was listening for the bass line in the left hand in the piano.  I found myself at times thinking, “*Wait, is that it, just one note?  It doesn’t feel like one note though.  Let me listen again, maybe I’m missing something.*”  

I think that because I have a strong emotional response to this song, I have a presupposition that this song has **supposed** to have multiple dimensions stemming from a plethora of intuitive note selection.  But no, it is not all that complex, which makes it all the more beautiful and peaceful to me how the song could be so multidimensional with such sparse use of notes.  I guess it is fitting, given the song’s title and use in the anime.

This arrangement is meant to be the first of many arrangement to come.  I have decided to dedicate 5 hours a week in writing arrangements for the first half of 2019, so hopefully you can see more of these posts this year.  **The plan for the upcoming weeks is to tackle as many songs from Hibike! Euphonium until the end of February,** and summarize them in a medley.  I have no idea how far I can get with that, but only time and effort will tell.

Any how, be on the look out for this one in the next 3 weeks!  I hope we can give do this song justice :)
