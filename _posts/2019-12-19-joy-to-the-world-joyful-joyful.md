excerpt: "Sometimes, doing your very best speaks volumes more than being the best.  This past weekend, I wrote and participated in two arrangements for FCBC Walnut’s In-Transit Christmas party.  This is the first of the two production notes where I detail some of the musical and collaborative intent that our team aimed for."

<hr>

Wow!  What a crazy weekend.  As the holiday festivities and events keep rolling in, the opportunities to serve, collaborate, and discover just keep coming and coming.  It is part of the reason why my favorite month of the year has always been December!

So for part 1 of 2 of the main crazy shenanigans this weekend, I helped out with worship singing (debatable choice of label here) for my church’s young adult Christmas outreach-ish party.  I wrote two arrangements for the set, and this one is the first of the two (the production notes for the second will come shortly after I promise!).  So with that, let’s get the ball rollin!

When the party was done and done, I took a look at the tapes above and confirmed that, in everything that I did this time around, it wasn’t the best.  For myself only, intonation was [incredibly shaky](https://youtu.be/_jPWxkIQYW0?t=47), rhythm was [ebbing and flowing](https://youtu.be/_jPWxkIQYW0?t=70), and accuracy was [lacking when it was needed most](https://youtu.be/_jPWxkIQYW0?t=88).  When you’re able to see and hear the crazy amounts of effort contributed by the other members of your team, it is frustrating to not do the things you want to do alongside them.

I wasn’t the only one, though, of course!  Matthew outright said he couldn’t play all of the arpeggios written throughout the piece.  Steph also outright said that her legs are going to die if she played the bass drum for every down beat.  Alvin struggled with the intro rhythm and opted out of playing it during the actual set.  As grand of a vision and ambition we had, there were actually a lot of things that all of us wanted to do, but couldn’t.

This is where practice and work outside work had a benefit.  I believe that, up until the time of the event, we had done all that we could.  With all that we have, we put together a package to the best of our abilities, and while it is unfortunate that the result was not up to a level that we personally could accept, it is a result that accurately displays where we’re at.  We put in as much as we could, so there was not anything more we could have done.

Don’t get me wrong, I didn’t see this collaboration in any sort of disappointing way.  Music is way, WAY, much more than just sounding good.  It is also a collaborative experience that unifies people under one common message that speaks volumes more.  While I believe we may have faltered here and there when it came to bringing the best to the table, I think that we, as a team, did a wonderful job of speaking the same message together as a collective.  So while we weren’t able to be the best we could, I think that we did the best we could.  Because that effort speaks so clearly and loudly to me, I am very, very happy.

# Some Arrangement Notes

Now, none of my production notes are complete without a little bit arrangement note diarrhea, so here are a few little tibbets that I want to point out from the resulting collaboration!

    </audio>
    <figcaption><i>Excerpt 1: Half Time Meter in Joy to the World</i></figcaption>
</figure>

This switch into this meter wasn’t in the original piece by Phil Wickham.  Does it sound familiar?  It should!  We already did a [similar switch](https://youtu.be/V87VHxL384Y?t=54) in meter in our arrangement of Zen Zen Zense!  The original intent of the switch was to break out of the hard 1-2-3-4 count in this piece and keep it fresh.  Now, I mentioned before, but Steph said that she can’t hold a hard 1-2-3-4 bass line for the whole piece, so we compromised and went with half of that on 1-3.  While the statement of the switch feels lightly softer, I think that this compromise still achieved the objective that I was gunning for.

Here’s another one:

    <figcaption><i>Figure 1: Leading Eighth Notes in the Piano Original Score for Joyful, Joyful</i></figcaption>
</figure>

For this one, the original intent was to use the 3 eighth notes to keep driving the bridge forward to hint to the listeners that this song is high octane, even to the very end.  It hints to say “we’re not going to carry this vocal/string only line into a quiet ending” that is pretty typical of ending lines of this nature.  So when everyone comes back in the repeat of the bridge verse, the hint is validated, as everyone is flooring the pedal to the end.

Next, we have the return of the arpeggios in the keys and the return of the chorus, all in tandem with the repeat of the new verse.  All of this means to push to cultivate a sense of energy and excitement for the lyrics of the piece:

</figure>

But at the very end, everyone suddenly drops out on the down beat of the piece, so we lied when we used the three eighth notes to signal high octane through the end:

    <figcaption><i>Figure 3: Sudden Cut-Out on the Last Note in the Original Score</i></figcaption>
</figure>

This was a very important drop out to me, because I wanted to turn the piece back to the singer.  We the worship team spend 3 minutes and 48 seconds pushing and pushing and pushing for high octane, to cultivate excitement and energy in singing praises, so at the end, I wanted the singers to be aware of their excitement.  By dropping out completely and forcing the singers to notice their own voice, I wanted them to notice where they were with their songs of praise.  It is an attempt to allow the listener to have a genuine reflection with themselves.

So to wrap all of that up, the 3 eighth notes that play during the bridge is the start of presenting this attempt to encourage self-reflection.  But if you took a listen, you would notice that what Matthew played does not align with the suggested countermelody line notated in the arrangement:

    </audio>

</figure>

Since, he didn’t play it, I have no other choice than to believe that his music degree and profession is nothing but a sham.  Just kidding (duh), he just forgot.  Singing, leading, and playing countermelodies all at the same time is a task that requires a lot of concentration across multiple fronts.

# Concluding Remarks

Ultimately, there was a lot of intent thrown into the arrangement that didn’t make it through into the actual set, but if I am to be real with myself, hardly does any of that intent translate outside of the arranger themselves, so it’s alright.  I can understand if an arranger would to take this happening as a negative, but in this case, I am happy to see the deviation.  We are not at the pinnacle of success here, so just as someone can take something you wrote and elevate it further than you imagine, someone can also take it and butcher it down like mince meat.  Not to say our attempt was mince meat, but our deviations from the original intent were happenings that could not be avoided given the situation.  Despite that though, I believe we were still able to capture the intent of the arrangement, and so all is well and ends well!

I only mentioned the missing parts of the piece, but there are so many added elements to the piece that I didn’t mention.  I’m leaving all the fun positive notes to my next production note for the IT Christmas event, but I’ll end by saying that I truly, truly, enjoyed the enthusiasm from our team.  I think that our energy and efforts were unified and transparent.  Even though we weren’t the best, I think we did our best, and by doing our best, I think we did all that we could in facilitating an environment for the congregation (attendees?) to go before God in sincere singing.

Christmas season is arrangement writing bonanza, so look forward to the next note soon!
