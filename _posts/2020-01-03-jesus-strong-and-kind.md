excerpt: "Build, Run, Counter.  For the last worship set of December, I used my standard steroid set to elevate CityAlight’s most recent song, “Jesus, Strong and Kind.”  In this production note, I highlight how I interpreted the intent of the piece, and how I used that interpretation to elevate the song for the purpose of facilitating a better space of wholehearted worship."

<hr>

Alrighty, now that all the December shenanigans are done (happy new decade!), I can slowly start chipping away at the production notes for all the arrangements that I wrote the past month.  There’s a decent amount, so I figure I’d start with the most recent (while it’s still fresh) and work my way backwards…

There is only really just one detail that I would like to highlight this time around for this note on “Jesus, Strong and Kind,” and that revolves around how the fourth verse was written for this piece.  But before I get to that, we need to contextualize things a little bit by taking a look at the first verse.

So here is the first verse, for the unfamiliar:

> *Jesus said that if I thirst, I should come to Him.*
> *No one else can satisfy, I should come to Him.*
>
> <cite class="align-right">— Verse 1 of "Jesus, Strong and Kind" by CityAlight</cite>

It doesn’t take a rocket scientist to figure out what the writer is going for here in verse one.  We, the singers, should come to Jesus.  “If X, come to Him.  Why?  Because Y, so come to Him.”  Come to Him.  Simple enough, got it.  To get a little more nitty-gritty, if you listen to the [original for this piece](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5Y8s-Sz_ac), I think it’s preeetttty safe to say that the audience is forced to really marinate in this simple idea.  The verse has a strong 1-2-3-4 pulse, orchestration is sparse, tempo is moderately slow, and pitch variation from note to note in minimal this piece.  All of that contributes to a pace that encourages singing with intent.

Now, this structure and intent, both in the instrumentation and lyrics in the verses, is followed pretty religiously (heh).  We actually get through two choruses and get pretty darn close to the end of the song before we reach the turning point in verse 4 that I would like to dig into.

So, again, for the uninitiated, here is verse 4:

> *Jesus said that if I’m lost, He will come to me.*
> *And he showed me on that cross, He will come to me.*
>
> <cite class="align-right">— Verse 4 of "Jesus, Strong and Kind" by CityAlight</cite>

If my absolute lack of ability to be succinct has any sort of saving quality, then hopefully you will immediately notice the difference between the two verses based on the point that I have already highlighted.  Instead of “coming to Him,” this verse states that “He will come to me.”  For verse 1 to 3, we sing about how we should come to Jesus.  Every third line, we are provided the reason, that is, no one else can be what we need, and so, we should come to Jesus.  The chorus builds on that reason, that is, Jesus is good and faithful, strong and kind.  For these reasons, come to Jesus.  Come.

Now here’s a little tangent (that is totally related, I promise…kinda).  For those who know me well, they would know that if I had the ability to do whatever I wanted in life, I would lay down and vegetate indefinitely (or until the stomach gets angry, then I pray to the fridge gods and hope that there are frozen dumplings downstairs for me to pan fry).  I am a particularly weak person when it comes to being the person to take any sort of action.  Keeping in touch with friends, developing my career, finding that eternal partner, writing production notes, you name it.  If it requires initial and active action, I struggle doing it.  Due to my circumstances in nature, consequences, and life, it is a constant battle that I fight day to day (for the curious, my win-loss ratio on this battle front is pretty embarrassing :D).

And there are people similar to me, who, for multitudes of reasons, cannot take initial action.  But unlike me, who acts like this out of laziness, pride, and insecurity, these people act out of genuinely crippling elements of life.  Due to genuine fear, hurt, guilt, sadness, or depression, they are unable to be the initiator.   They know things, understand things, and despite being the often rational person that they are, make the irrational (yet very valid) decision not to take that step out and forward, not because they are not strong enough, but because they are unable.

So, I’d like to believe that CityAlight has those people in mind when they wrote not just the fourth verse of “Jesus, Strong and Kind,” but the whole piece as well.  Despite singing it for nearly 3/4s of the song, this song does not center around coming before Jesus, but rather, that Jesus will come to us.  Immediately after singing “he will come to me,” the [instruments come crashing back](https://youtu.be/T5Y8s-Sz_ac?t=154) in on the justification, that is, that “…he showed us on that cross, he will come to me.”  It is a song of encouragement to the weak and broken.  That, if we are lost, he will come to us.  It does not mean we ought not to try and come before Jesus, but if we are unable, he will come to us.

# Arrangement Notes

Alright, less Jesus talk now, more music talk.  The thematic center above came crashing into me when I took a closer look at the piece, and so, to align with my philosophy that strings exist to amplify in worship arrangements, I began to think of ways to elevate this line.  How do I help encourage an environment to allow those who are unable, to sing in full confidence of the sovereign grace of Jesus?  Cue flipping through my mental library of tools at my disposal…

First step, **build**!

</figure> 

If you have been attending FCBC Walnut the past few months, I wouldn’t fault you for being sick of this method by now.  I became hyper aware of this incredibly simple yet effective build method of [spamming articulated eighth notes until the climax through Matthew’s arrangement of “Surely Goodness, Surely Mercy.”](https://youtu.be/r6CmcotooDI?t=569)  Like all great ideas in life, I steal them, use them improperly, and milk the positives until they are desert dry.  The only difference this time around is that I opted to alternate between notes inside the chord in the violins to keep the phrase from being too prominent.

But actually, if you listen to the worship tapes from the past Sunday, you will notice that [I opted to play 16th notes instead of 8th notes](https://youtu.be/5kkHap1vhwI?t=185) as notated.  I was already struggling between the two ideas before even approaching rehearsal, and I felt that it wouldn’t hurt to give it a try to see if I could bring a little more to the table with 16th notes.  More on this later.  

For now, let’s move on to the next step, **run**!

<figure class="align-center">
    <img src="/images/2020/01/03/figure-2-runs-in-the-chorus-after-verse-4.png" alt="">
    <figcaption><i>Figure 2: Runs in the Chorus after Verse 4</i></figcaption>
</figure> 

Runs are a little difficult to play when you’re sightreading, but much less so when it’s in an easy key like C or D.  As I become more familiar with the musicians that I work with, I have been trying to sneak in more and more runs into our arrangements.  I believe our string players to be more than capable to play the things I write, and by slowly ramping up the difficulty, I’m hoping that they will develop their own methods (whether in practice or in sightread technique) to be able to tackle these when needed.

I think a mistake here is that these runs are way too short.  I backloaded them to be at the back of the measure (and beginning of the next phrase) so that they would not be a distraction, but because of the short length, by the time we register that a run is happening, the run is over.  It is another instance where I only commit halfway, and because of that, all the effort and energy goes to waste.  I guess that would need some revision.  If we ever play this piece again, I plan to extend the lengths of these runs to fill the duration of the measure (to connect the prior phrase to the next).

And now the last step, **counter**!

<figure class="align-center">
    <img src="/images/2020/01/03/figure-3-countering-the-main-melody-in-the-chorus-following-verse-4.png" alt="">
    <figcaption><i>Figure 3: Countering the Main Melody in the Chorus Following Verse 4</i></figcaption>
</figure> 

One of the easiest ways (but pretty darn hard to do in slow, soft, ballad-type pieces) to introduce another dimension to a piece is to create a countermelody.  Done right, you create a lovely, perhaps subtle conversation with the main character of the story.  Done poorly, you create a jumbled, dissonant, noisy mess that is like walking into a restaurant that is way too loud to have a meaningful conversation in.

To avoid being at that 4.5 star Yelp restaurant that probably paid a decent penny to keep their Internet reputation up (totally not salty about a recent food place I’ve been to), a good idea to keep in mind is to have your counter statements happen when the main melody’s phrases end, and then have the counter statements encourage direction when the main melody’s phrases are front and center.  This is what I aimed to do with the countermelody in the chorus following verse 4.

Right after the word “faithful,” I have the strings move (pitch-wise) in a downward motion, so that the following main melody connects with the previous phrase.  As the main melody sings “keep us day and night,” the melodic line moves in a downward motion, but to keep the phrase going, I let the strings move upwards.  This upward motion propels the piece toward the downbeat in m.66.  But lo!  Behold, I cheat the congregation out of the hard landing of the Gsus (aw yeah, the famous Jesus chord) in m.66 by omitting the downbeat note, despite the prior phrase suggesting that a hard land is coming.  I believe by doing this, I am able to amplify the suspenseful nature of a sus chord, and allow for the resolution to be even more cathartic than if we were to join in on the down beat.  After supplementing the return of the main melody with a string run, I have the strings go back to their half/quarter note duty, paying close attention to making sure that a high note is present to let the congregation know that there is an instrument out there singing louder and higher than them.  So rest assured, go nuts in belching out those lyrics.  And as I did in m.64, I make sure to fill the blank space in the main melody in m.68 to keep the phrase going.

Whew, that was quite a diarrhea.  If none of that registers, you can just know this:  the counter that I wrote meant to dance around and dialogue with the main melody.  By hovering and interacting with the main melody, the purpose of the counter is not to join in part of the brilliance, but to create a foundation for the main melody to shine even brighter.  To me, the counter melody is like that background dancer that makes that 5-year old on America’s Got Talent look amazing, or your one homie that acts like a dimwit so that you look cooler in front of your crush.  Ok, maybe not that latter example, but you get the point.

# Concluding Remarks

When our worship lead Aaron sent an email to us two weeks earlier than our scheduled service Sunday to let us know that we were going to sing CityAlight’s most recent song, I already knew the piece was likely going to be similar in nature to “Yet Not I, But Through Christ in Me.”  And sure enough, like “Yet Not I, But Through Christ in Me,” “Jesus, Strong and Kind” is a simple, delicate piece that emphasizes the identity of Christ, and how we as the congregation can take solace in the sovereign grace of Jesus amidst all things.  In order to elevate this piece to 110% so that the congregation can perhaps sing maybe 1% more earnestly and wholeheartedly, I used my standard steroid set of building, running, and countering to ramp up the piece at the critical turning point that is verse 4 into the chorus.

While I believe the raw ideas made it out there to the congregation, I feel that, again, due to the lack of a full commitment to my inspirations, the arrangement came out fine, but could have been better.  Remember how I experimented on the actual set by playing 16th notes instead of eighth notes?  That experimentation was out of the discontent of where the current arrangement is.  Ever since I had my heart absolutely captivated by the instrumental tracks from Shoujo Kageki Revue Starlight (Numero uno OST of 2019, by the way, here’s one [that’s saturated with dynamic intent](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2UTdpwkyFY) for the curious), I’ve been trying to look for ways to imitate that style, given the skill sets that we have at our disposal.  While I can only dream of being able to write (let alone play) music with that level of complexity, delicacy, and dexterity, I found it to be a goal worth working toward, as I think only genuine good can come out of that struggle.

The arrangement doesn’t crash and burn, but if I call myself a musician and a slave to Christ, then I definitely should not settle here and be content with what I have to offer for this time around.  Hopefully next time I can do better!
