A cover of Hibike! Euphonium ~Chikai no Finale~'s "Tsudzureta Omoi" by Kamaso String Quartet. KyoAni's animes have been without a doubt the most impactful productions for all of us. In light of the recent tragedy, we hope that KyoAni can take time to mourn, and bounce back stronger than ever.

<hr>

So this is the first arrangement/recording note that I get to write since the expiration of the Kamaso Quartet domain.  Since I decided not to renew that, I decided to move all my notes over there to my personal domain here, which means that now whenever I have an arrangement/recording worth talking about, the talks will go here.  **And since this is my personal domain, as is customary, DOTM and transparent/casual styles shall be acceptable.**  Rejoice (or weep) my friends.

Alrighty, so this one was done kinda on the whim.  If it wasn’t obvious enough already, “Hibike! Euphonium” is by far my favorite anime by KyoAni.  Actually, maybe even of all time.  Either way, the latest movie for the series (“Hibike! Euphonium ~Chikai no Finale~”) was penned in to premiere at select US theaters, and so of course I had to book a ticket to watch before the rest of the US gets a chance to.

In prep for that, I decided to watch the whole “Hibike! Euphonium” series again as a refresher.  I felt that I was able to get a lot more out of the movie than I would have if I had not done a rewatch binge the week before.  KyoAni really puts a lot of their heart and soul into their Hibike productions, and I spent a lot of my efforts in the past trying to try and give some public recognition to KyoAni, at least my close friends.

The reason I bring that up is I believe that my re-engagement with KyoAni’s masterpiece contributed to a strange combination of emotions when I woke up one morning to see KyoAni on the news for an arson attack.  I definitely started off angry, because why would people have to do that?  Elements of sadness crept in after the initial shock, disappointingly, because I was thinking about the future of their craft, and not of their personnel.  And then a bit of frustration started kicking in when every news outlet, station, and webpage was littered with comments on KyoAni.  I’ve always wanted them to be recognized for their art, and not for what happens to them.  **There were a lot more emotions bouncing around in my head that were easily triggered depending on what I heard or saw, and at the end of the day, I couldn’t really put a finger on how I was feeling.**

**So this arrangement of “Tsudzurareta Omoi” (which, suitably enough, translates to “Spelled Out Thoughts”) was pretty much started as a means to attempt to express that internal kerfuffle.**  As I always do with anything that I enjoyed, I went through the Chikai no Finale OST right after the movie, and this one struck a chord (heh) with me.

# Arrangement Notes

The first portion of the song that I wanted to talk about was Matsuda Akito’s use of perfect fifths and perfect fourths.  In the first half of the piece, there is a curious feeling of ambivalence that doesn’t get shaken off until the string group joins the party.  Turns out, our lovely composer Matsuda Akito decided to smash the B and A notes for harmony as much as possible in this song (written in E).  Perfect intervals are definitely fun to work with, as I never really felt them to be easily characterized as dissonant or consonant.  **Definitely felt that ambiguous character of the perfect interval really contributed to expressing the inability to clearly express.**

The cello also enters during the perfect interval parts, and there’s this lovely conversation that happens between the piano and the cello.  The cello comes in, and the piano responds in between its phrases with its smashing on the Bs and As.. In part B of this sequence, the piano finally aligns itself (rhythmically, at least) to the cello, but still landing on perfect interval.  Progress, but we, as the listeners, are still left questioning where this piece is going, due to all the ambiguity Matsuda Akito created in the harmony.

And then what happens?  Boom, major drop.  Specifically, a major third with E and G.  With a bunch (and I mean, a BUNCH) of strings.  All that messy ambiguity created with the piano and cello from before?  Resolved.  On a major third.  At last, we got our direction, our feelings, and our expression from Matsuda Akito.  **Coupling the interval selection of a major third with the color of a string group, the cathartic release when the strings come creates quite the musical frisson.**

# Recording Notes

Moving on to the next topic.  **Now, “noise” in recordings and music isn’t a particularly new or revolutionary idea, but I have to admit that my re-exposure to that in KyoAni’s “Koe no Katachi” did help in getting me slightly more interested in that idea.**  This idea was again present in KyoAni’s “Liz to Aoi Tori,” and with that idea fresh in mind, I definitely felt that the noise in Matthew’s recorded portion became an integral part of the color of this piece.

So, different from most of the recordings I’ve post-processed, I kept and amplified the noise from Matthew’s practice room in the introduction.  The hum of the AC, the squeaks of the hardwood floors, and the thump from the piano chair—all of that, I felt, was very complimentary to the solemn and tranquil nature of the piece.  I considered the amplified noises in the beginning to be the intro of the song.  The result for me is that the piano’s first note as a result is a note of expression, rather than a note of performance.  **The recording was not a performance to sound amazing, but rather, was a recording to express, which ended up sounding amazing.**  I think the noise, the visuals, and just the performing posture that Matthew chose, all contributed to a display that expression.

Now on to the cello.  Being a violinist myself, I knew how the cello’s melodic line could be easily segmented in to note-to-note phrases.  And so, I wrote slurs in to encourage the cellist to avoid that, and to partition his or her bow accordingly.  Yes, the resulting bowing is harder, but the trade-off for the difficulty was a better phrase.  **A lot of times, when I write bowing marks in, I am deciding between difficulty and phrase, and, depending on the affected musicians and importance of the performance, I pen them in accordingly.**

<figure class="align-center">

    <figcaption><i>Figure 3: Bowing marks in the cello solo part to encourage a long, balanced phrase.</i></figcaption>
</figure>

Too often do I see my consideration overwritten by another musician that would always prioritize conforming with the group, or opting for the easiest bowing.  I am very pleased to see that Alvin recognized that and tried to drive the vision I set in the arrangement home.  Granted, his execution is shakier than the official recording (duh), but I did feel that the expression got through his execution, and for that, I am happy to hear.

# Concluding Remarks

Though I could probably talk a little bit more about the nature of the arrangement, I’d like to wrap up my thoughts of this piece, as this post is getting quite long winded.  Do you see a trend in my thoughts for this piece?  If you felt that I spent a lot of time assuming things about expression, then you are right.  For me, expression is so much more important than any other element in music.  It’s not just for this piece, I consider this central to my approach to music.  Being amazing in music requires a pure fixation on expression.   Amazing shouldn’t be the goal, but rather, expression should.  Amazing-ness, to me, is a byproduct of expression.  **I believe any musical piece or performance can be mind-blowingly beautiful so long as it is rich in expression.**  Except contemporary music, that stuff will always be trash.  I am also not advocating for skipping practice.  Y’all make sure to practice (speaking to myself too), so that you can bring your A-game anytime anywhere.

When Matsuda Akito composes for KyoAni’s “Hibike! Euphonium” franchise, he is always using a toolbox of the simplest elements to create pieces rich in expression.  Definitely a composer advocating the “less is more” philosophy.  In this arrangement and recording, I tried to imitate that, by adding a noisy introduction, and by forcing certain phrasing.  **I believe that through this arrangement and recording process for this piece, I was able to take my jumbled-up feelings and organize them in an understandable way through music.**  As for what I ended up trying to express…I tried my best to express my heartfelt sorrow for those affected by the arson attack, my gratitude towards the content that have created to date, and my hope that the company would be able to bounce back stronger than ever.  Hopefully my thoughts made it through!
