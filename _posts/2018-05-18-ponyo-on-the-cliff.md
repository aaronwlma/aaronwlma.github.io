I FINISHED PONYO. Hallelujah. I’ve probably heard “Ponyo ponyo ponyo sakana no ko” over 200 times now and thankfully I haven’t ripped my ears out. But by God’s grace I guess I’ve made it through…I’d say roughly 30 hours of work? For a 2 minute 45 second score lol. I think even though Melodyphony didn’t have the orchestral score for Ponyo, Ponyo wasn’t the hardest title I tackled up to date. At first I thought it would be terribly difficult being unique for each verse and chorus, but after laying out the melody and the first half of Ponyo, I realized that there wasn’t a need to try and be fancy with it. I felt that all three choruses could have the same notes as long as the verses had different variations. 

Actually, I felt like it was necessary for the choruses to have the same style/notes, otherwise I felt like the catchy-ness of the chorus sorta disappeared. I did change Violin II’s part for the last chorus though to match the Budokan performance though–I thought that it was a good way to segue (not segway…) into the ending remark. 

Also though, I went through my other arrangements by actually playing them on the violin and I thought, “oh I probably need to practice this part…and that part…and that part…” And then it hit me, why am I writing things to be so difficult? Who am I even writing for? What is it even for? And I thought oh right, it’s for a reception. It’s not for us to steal attention, but to provide an environment for people to chat in. Then my priority should ought be to sound solid, and not to have to play difficult chromatic scales in sixteenth notes. So I avoided being fancy in Ponyo as much as possible. I also went back on all my scores and simplified them. Actually, I think trying to be as simply as possible ended up being a good constraint for Ponyo. 

But yeah, I finished the notes, and tomorrow I’ll finish it up by making the score clean and organized. After that I’ll probably try and tackle perhaps Country Road (because I feel compelled to do it). It’s a little optimistic of me but, I hope to be able to get through two more this week on my own. Titles being Country Road and Merry Go Round of Life. If Beethoven possesses me this week then maybe I can add in Spirited Away but uh, that’s like hoping to win the lotto I guess.
