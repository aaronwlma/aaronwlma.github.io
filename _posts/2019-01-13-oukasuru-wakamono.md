I was not expecting to come back and write so soon, but **Oukasuru Wakamono from Hibike Euphonium 2’s OST is complete!**  Woohoo!  Again!

I must say that in the past 10 years that I’ve been dabbling with arrangements, **Oukasuru Wakamono was BY FAR the most pleasurable to transcribe.**  A lot of times when it comes to quartet music, there’s a central melody, and a counterpoint here or there.  The melody gets passed around in some compositions, and woop, it’s over.  And that’s it.  So when I transcribe quartet music, usually by the time I finish charting out the main melody, I get significantly less interested, as all the supporting lines tend to be bland and only really serve to support the main melody.

Oukasuru Wakamono was not like that.  **After I charted out the main melody, the more I wrote out the supporting lines, the more I realized that they weren’t supporting lines at all.**  Each line had a distinct melodic flow that complemented, supplemented, and supported the main melody.  This idea was totally present in not just Violin II, but Viola (Violoncello I for my arrangement) as well.  So all three main lines (Violin I, Violin II, and Violoncello I) was in constant dialogue and harmony with their counterparts.  Not a totally foreign feeling, but definitely pretty magical seeing that conversation develop note by note.  If you listen to the midi render below, pay attention to Violin II at 1:09!  The countermelody there is super catchy.  And then pair it with Violoncello I!  Quite the elaborate dance they got goin’ on there.

Oh, and as for Violoncello II, he’s on bass note duty.  Thank you very much for your service, fellow musician.

I was relatively excited all the way through to transcribe this one, so I actually have no idea how long the next one might end up being.  I still don’t really know which one I want to tackle next, but hopefully I can chime in again soon!
