It’s done!  Transcribed, recorded, and edited!  Woohoo.  Awesome, but the Hibike journey is only 1% finished, so we can’t throw the towel in just yet.  But hey, I’m not a party pooper that poops on parties, so let’s break it down to keep the unce unce going.

I alluded to it earlier in my arrangement notes for this piece, but Heion Naru Hibi has a special place in my heart because of the peacefulness it invokes in me.  Rough day at work?  Shalom, my friend.  Life dealt you a poor hand today?  Shalom, my friend.  **I mean, the title of the song is pretty much “peaceful days” in English, so I can’t exactly say that I’ve discovered the latest and greatest solution to world peace here.**  But nonetheless, I’m glad that we could record this peace (heh) without me losing some of the piece’s magic.

The recording setup was standard.  Two AKG P170s, pointed at the upper and lower parts of the piano roughly 5 inches away from the strings, and one Shure KSM32, aimed at the left F hole of the cello roughly 6 inches from the hole.  I like this two microphone set up on the piano a lot because **with the piano, a good post-process 30% L and R pan for the two channels gives the piano track a nice, full, sound that wraps around the strings you throw in the center.**  I think it’s a great compromise when you’re on a budget and cannot set up 8 microphones all for the grand piano.  The KSM32 does a pretty decent job as well with strings because of its wide frequency response.  Definitely didn’t have any problems on the hardware portions of the recording.

Of course, while we love music and practice actively (right guys?…guys?), I can’t outright lie and say that I think that this is the absolute perfect replication of Heion Naru Hibi, so I will put a fire under the bottoms of our pianist Matthew and cellist Alvin here (thanks for being a good sport guys) for the sake of team/self-reflection.  For the cello, I felt that the phrasing had less direction that the original piece, especially with the trail off notes for each mini phrase (Example at 0:20 and 0:23).  As for the piano, I felt that the movement of the bass notes could have been more strongly emphasized (Example at 1:18, 1:31).  Coupling this with the slower tempo that we decided to take, the phrasing in the cello as well as the softer emphasis of the piano caused for our version of Heion Naru Hibi to call for less of an emotional response in the listener.  At least, that is how I feel.  I feel that if we were conscious of these issues, we would have been able to call for a similar magical feeling that the original Heion Naru Hibi created in me.

But, given the time we had allotted to rehearsing and recording this piece, I am very pleased with what we were able to produce.  We did a great job understanding the peaceful nature of this piece, and gave a commendable effort to portray that in our performanship (is this a word? I hope so, this text tool is saying it isnt…).  **Matthew did a great job of countering Alvin’s melody, and Alvin did a great job at using his bow subdivisions to complement his phrasing and tone.**

Next up is…actually I don’t know what’s next.  Let’s call it a surprise, for you, and for me.  What ever it may be, be on the look out for it!
