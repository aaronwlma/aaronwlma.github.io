I was gifted a CGP Grey Theme Journal back in 2021, and I used it as a template to drive some of my action items for 2022.  This honestly worked out pretty well, and so I decided that I'd use the same template (with some modifications) to drive 2023 as well.

Here's the TL;DR for future referencing, or for the lazy readers:

### **Theme**: 
> - **Year of Pruning** - Cut to grow.  Abandon bad habits, stagnant environments, and negativity, so that the healthy branches of life can flourish.

### **Focus Areas and Outcomes**:
> - **Physical Health** - (P0) Reduce unhealthy consumption, (P1) improve calculated running.
> - **Mental Health** - (P0) Reduce community reliance, couch-idling, and career growth, (P1) increase deliberate positoovity.
> - **Music** - (P1) Reduce responsibilities weight, (P0) increase personal guitar and streamlined string maintenance weight.
> - **Finance** - (P1) Reduce untracked spending, (P1) improve home-buying savings.

### Deliverables:
> - **Physical Health**
>     - (Prune) Remove DoorDashing from work days.  Meal prep work days.
>     - (Prune) Running regimen to build distance and trail running training.
>     - (Grow) Complete a half-marathon according to a training schedule.
> - **Mental Health**
>     - (Prune) Don't use chats for diarrhea of the mouth.
>     - (Prune) Stay off the couch on work days.
>     - (Prune) Establish tight working hours and do not exceed or shirk on them.
>     - (Prune) Filter out negative Internet platforms.
> - **Music**
>     - (Prune) Accept string padding Berean worship.
>     - (Grow) Daily guitar learning and practice.
>     - (Prune) Daily violin practice for intonation.
>     - (Grow) Establish pitchable platform for string arrangement
> - **Finance**
>     - (Grow) Hit 20% down payment saved for a new home.

# Reflection
2022, the year of foundations, was a year of rapid personal growth and establishment.  It saw positive things like the birth of a new running hobby, the foundation of a more defined direction for my string music, and a structure to manage my tendency to hoard information and digital assets.

2022 was also a year where poor foundations grew as well.  Because of the growing responsibilities (amongst other things), I developed poor habits of reaching for easy yet pricey delivery meals, longer-than-admittable couch idling Internet consumption sessions, and over-indexing on community for mental support.

And so, like any plant that grows messily, I believe that 2023 warrants a proper look into pruning away the forementionend undesired things that grew in 2022.  **Without this care, I think 2023 carries a risk of ending up in a position where I do a whole lot of something, and yet a whole lot of nothing.**  Motion, without progress.

The poor foundations grew in the midst of the good ones for a reason--they're the easy and quick solution to the immediate problem, the painkiller for the injuries.  Painkillers and quick solutions have their uses, and I don't think any sort of expectation of cold cut declarations will actually guide myself towards a more fruitful life.  And so, **the pruning efforts around addressing the poor foundations should be aiming for *reduction* and/or *conscious consumption***. 

# Spaces
With that being said, here are the said bold declarations of what I aim to see in the results of pruning this year, respective of the focus areas mentioned in the TL;DR above:

## Physical Health
> (P0) Reduce DoorDash consumption, (P1) improve calculated running.

### DoorDash
The total monetary value lost due to DoorDash-ing in 2022 has yet to be calculated, but it doesn't take a number for me to recognize that I had DoorDashed too much in 2022.  While it saved me a lot of time thinking about food, cooking, and cleaning, the food offered in DoorDash is not the most healthy, and that likely offset a lot of the wins that I got by establishing a running habit in 2022.

Establishing good eating habits is critical to long-term health, and for ease-of-mind when physical problems happen.  Reducing DoorDash consumption is thus not only needed for physical health, but for mental health (and bonus finances) as well.  It is also pretty black and white to measure, and thus should be put at the forefront of my attention for 2023, hence it's P0 priority.

### Running
The second part of this is related to my personal short and long term goals for running.  I wish to train up and run a half-marathon this year in 2023, with the longer term goal of being able to regularly participate in half-marathon events, and a stretch goal of being able to conduct trail runs to experience more of the nature wonders of the world.

Since longevity and sustainability is at the forefront of this overall goal, simply turbo-ing through daily runs does not yield efficient progress (and frankly, could induce hobby-ending injuries).  In order to reach both the short, long, and possibly stretch goals, running regiments with focused micro-goals should be established.

This will require research and observation, but by the end of 2023, it would be good if I had a calculated schedule for different types of training runs instead of powering through 4-7 miles a day, 6 days a week.  Not the end of the world if not accomplished, but runs the risk of injury if irresponsibly left.  Hence, P1.

## Mental Health
> (P0) Reduce community reliance, couch-idling, and career growth, (P1) increase deliberate positoovity.

### 
The increased intensity of 2022 in order to work towards 2022 goals increased the dependency on community support.  Specifically, with more things being done and more things being experienced, both good and bad, came stronger desires to share the moments with people I consider important to me.

This likely requires a post in itself, but the harsh reality of being a single young adult in the 21st century is that this becomes less and less acceptable the older you get.  Graduating college means your community disperses and experiences newer and unique things that take membbers on their own path.  As friends get married, they have a greater focus on their spouse and inevitably look more inward than outward, with the support of their significant other.

Single young adults do not have that privilege, and additionally, single folks learn that relationships with their community will constantly change as a result of their community forming families.  Daily exchanges will run dry, conversations will grow increasingly filtered, and exciting/rough moments will be unrelatable by anyone other than themselves.  And so, as a single young adult, asking that their commmunity uphold these once-valued interactions is putting the onus on folks that will inevitably fail you.

The better course of action is to, as always, look at the things you can affect.  In this case, is learning to manage thoughts, expression, and emotions in ammaner that does not rely on an attentive ear or invested individual.  Learning this would tie into the P1, that is, improve conscious positoovity as well.

When I reflect on the most heated times that I experienced in 2022, this onus was at the core of that.  And so, I consider this a P0 action item for myself in order for me to grow older in a sustainable manner.

Another heated item that I experienced in 2022 was in career.  Something that year 2 at Meta has brought to me is recognizing that, at the end of the day, I am indeed a work to live sort of individual.  I have over-indexed in career progression and that rush has led me to feeling burned out and lost.  As a result, I think it is best for me to take it easy.  Temper my expectations for progression and learning, and if that results in a terminated job, so be it.  The tech layoffs of 2022 has shown that the opposite (high performance and importance) doesn't lead to security anyway.  Being average is the best goal for me for a sustainable career.  Important, but not life devastating, P1.

Lastly, all the mental stress of a failing community, unreal work expectations, and looming physical ailment led to me finding great comfort in laying on the couch and letting time pass by.  It is important to rest, and I acknowledge that the weight of things around me are indeed something I personally find heavy.

Still, the idling only alleviated the situation, but didn't point toward a direction of action.  While resting on the couch will still be important for me in 2023, I need to find a way to convert that pain suppressor into a medicine.  Finding a process to reinvigorate myself in light of the heavy things around me will help the day-to-day living be a little more forward-moving.  Also important, but not life devastating, so P1.

### Music
> (P1) Reduce Berean weight, (P0) improve personal guitar progress and streamlined string maintenance.

Music creation is important to me, but not so much for everyone around me.  For the better or worse, I have had the ability to pour my heart, mind, and soul into every music creating opportunity I have had in 2023.

But the reality is that I am hitting my bandwidth limitation, as much as I do not want to admit that.  Simply put, I do not have the energy and time to continue doing that in 2023, if I wish to be more diligent with pruning.  Not all music creating opportunities are equal in weight, and I think that it is now wise for me to stop treating them all as equals, and instead put deliberate effort levels that match my personal weight on each opportunity.

This leads to the P1, reducing Berean weight.  Berean worship runs 6 songs per set, and I serve on worship once every 3 months.  In 2022, it has taken me roughly a total of 12-15 hours each week to fulfill this responsibility, and that has taken a significant chunk of my energy and time every 3 weeks.  There is very little gain for myself personally, and, to my knowledge, I have doubts that toiling in the way that I do has blessed the church in the ways that I hoped.  I don't think the lost energy has a proportional benefit to the church, and I think this is another area that I should take it easy.

The reason I want to take it easy is so that I can focus more on my personal music creation ambition.  That is, establishing guitar and streamlining strings.

Being a string player means you really have no driving voice.  There is an absurd amount of power in amplification for strings, but you can't amplify something that is not there, and that has frustrated me to no end.  You absolutely need to stand on the shoulder of giants, and the helplessness of being a string player motivates me to pick up the guitar and be the driver myself.  I think doing so will unlock my music creation potential in many, many ways.  I also failed to do this in 2022, and that adds to the frustration.  And so, P0.

That being said, I still absolutely love strings.  I love the exponential amplification that strings provide to music, and through the music adventures of 2022 (TaBi-MiX, worship arrangements, personal projects), I have discovered that my string experiences may fill a niche that may exist out there.  I think that I have developed a skillset in creating string accompaniments, as well as being a relatively plug-and-playable violinist for stage performances.

However, they are rough around the edges, and thus, every opportunity that I had in 2022 was met with personal disappointment in my deliverables.  I think that with a little more effort, packaging my string accompaniment adventures in a pitchable way as well as putting effort to tighten up my intonation will enable me to create a music platform that sticks around as an open door for future opportunities that can being some excitement to my dull-er engineering life.  Doing this will be
