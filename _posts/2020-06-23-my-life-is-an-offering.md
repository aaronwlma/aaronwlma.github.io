excerpt: "Alas, it is finally time for me to bust out the country fiddlin’. In this production of note of “My Life is An Offering,” I go through five key vibes that I kept in mind as I wrote in a style that I normally don’t write in for FCBC Walnut’s remote worship recordings."

<hr>

And I’m back!  Again!  Yes I am using that opener again!  It’s almost like I’ve run out of creative ideas (I did)!  But if I keep throwing exclamation points out, then maybe it’ll look fresh and new (it doesn’t)!  Yay!  Woohoo!

Lol (another “lol” transition?!).   Jokes aside (AGH), I am indeed back for another blurb.  This time, I had the privilege once again to write an arrangement for FCBC’s remote response worship, “My Life is An Offering.”  I remember when our worship leader Aaron L. wanted to play his reinterpretation of “My Faith Has Found a Resting Place” for FCBC worship back in 2019, he very clearly stated “no country music.”  And I remember sitting in Matthew’s apartment in LA just thinking, “how do I even do that, with such a swinging motion?”  The result of that endeavor was that once Matthew returned from his Aida performance, Matthew and I had to rely on the music of the night to fill in the few blanks in that arrangement.  T’was quite a challenge that I learned a lot from.

This time around though, there was no specific requirement to meet, for the better or worse.  So when I first heard the piece, I thought that there was a nice little swing vibe goin’ that was pretty nice.  So I mildly amused myself in thinkin’ about possibly putting some country swings and scoops in, since there was no criteria and all yanno?  But once I heard Joyce’s cajon added to the mix, **my amusement became pretty much a requirement.  I felt like it would be a huge waste of everyone’s effort if I did not match their musical interpretation**, and so, after a year of writing arrangements here and there for FCBC Walnut, I finally got a chance to indulge slightly in a style of fiddlin’ that I personally find quite exhilarating to muse around in.

So, here are five little ways that I focused in on this time around to get that country vibin’ goin, kinda.

# Vibe #1: Slidin' and Scoopin'
Here’s a couple of scoops that I littered across the piece.

It was a little annoying because Sibelius playback doesn’t pre-process, and so scooping from the front means that there is no playback representation of the scoop, and so a bit of imagination was required this time around.

I think I first took notice of the scoop notation in Adam Neely’s orchestrations on his videos.  I thought it was a neat way to micromanage your musicians into playing what you wanted them to play, and so I gave the scoop notation a try.  Lol.  Disrespectful jokes aside, **I think that slides/scoops are a pretty typical way of delivering that "country vibe,"** so it was pretty much a given to slide and scoop when possible.

Fun side-thought, this intro was the starting point for me in terms of ideas.  The 2nd and 3rd interludes that came after were then built as a response to this idea.  And so this first bar that starts with a hard slide into the first note was actually adapted from Meguru Mono’s “Ashioto Marching.”  Looks like there’s no YT link for me to share it, so here’s the snippet that I found inspiration from:

# Vibe #2: Repeatin' Bendy Notes in Success'n

This fiddlin' "technique" is a little bit in tandem with "style."  I feel like arrangers at times are afraid to repeat notes, because they are afraid of the possibility that repeating notes are too obnoxious, or that that repeating notes or phrases demonstrates a lack of creativity (like drone notes and string pads).  So, in their efforts to try and always provide something new and fresh, they completely forget that repetition could be a very powerful tool if used tastefully.

But country vibers use it a lot.  **They repeat notes (and even throw drone notes underneath it all) and rhythms quite frequently to evoke that sense of swing and head bobbin’ that we all come to love (or hate) about country fiddlin’.**  These are just two examples of an instance where I hang out on a note a couple times in succession.  

# Vibe #3: Texture Via Articulat'n

Another trap that comes with writing for strings is that writers forget that strings can do more than push and pull their bows.  Or even, sometimes string players also forget that they can do more than push and pull their bows.  Lol.  **The string instrument can be used for way more than just providing a string pad, and knowing how to utilize the bow techniques can give your arrangement and writing an element of texture that freshens up the piece.**

Here’s an aggressive one:

<figure class="align-center">
    <img src="/images/2020/06/23/fig-6-tremelos-in-contrast-to-the-fat-quarter-notes-in-the-bridge.png" alt="">

    </audio>

</figure>


This one ain’t necessarily country vibin’, but it is something I did want to point out as a means to create texture.  The pattern of a long note into a spamming of shorts, back into a long and then back into spamming shorts creates a strong contrast of texture that drives the listeners forward.

And here’s a tinier, but equally important one:

<figure class="align-center">

**Music is generally an experience with listening, but there are times where using other sensory language can help people better understand how others experience music.**  When I chat with my friends on the color of a sound, I tend to use the word “spicy.”  When I chat with my friends on how I visualize playing the violin or how parts interact with each other, I tend to use the word “dance.”

The phrase above to me was like a dance sequence.  We have a wind up (orange), that builds us into two short hops (green) into a mid air pose on the climax note (blue).  We then land  gracefully (pink), only to strike a pose and wink at the audience with our little scoop (brown), and then return back into our routine (yellow).  I found that when I tried to visualize my phrases as a dance number, texture via articulation comes with the territory.  Funnily enough (to myself, I guess),  **I feel that when visualizations comes to mind, my personality truly begins to shine through the arrangements I write.**

# Vibe #4: Glisen'n Glissandos

This one is my favorite in this arrangement, but it is also not really about the country vibin’, lol.  But to set the scene, here’s a recent failure story about me that plagues me even ‘til today…

Matthew participated in a Little Mermaid musical earlier this year, and the pit orchestra needed a violinist to play.  Matthew, with his confidence in me, extended that request to me.  I had confidence in his confidence in me, and so I agreed.

But after looking at the music for a couple days, **I was overwhelmed by the possibility of screwing it all up.**  I was not accustomed to the eccentric rhythm, there were some high notes that I felt would be difficult to land consistently, and there were some string runs that I couldn’t deliver in a crisp fashion.

Soooo, I backed out.  I knew that I would regret it if I backed out, but I still did.  **I lost confidence in my friend’s confidence in me and that really was something that pointed out one of my short comings.**

Buuut I did learn some things along the way.  One of those things that I learned along the way was when I was totally freakin’ out over trying to play the string runs nice and crisp-ily.  Matthew told me that I didn’t need to fret too much over them, because “they’re just mainly for texture anyway, no one’s going to be able to hear you specifically.”

And that came to mind when I wrote this part:

<figure class="align-center">
    <img src="/images/2020/06/23/fig-8-using-the-piano-glissando-in-tandem-with-a-string-32nd-note-run-to-add-some-glitter.png" alt="">

    </audio>
    <figcaption><i>Excerpt 8: Using the Piano Glissando in Tandem with a String 32nd Note Run to Add Some Glitter</i></figcaption>
</figure>


Did I really believe that we could play those 32nd notes crisp-ily?  Negatory, dudes.  Sorry, but I don’t have Matthew’s confidence level in my musicians.  I did not expect that we would play it cleanly.  But **music is a collaborative effort, so if we all suck at playing it, we can drown each other out and create just mainly texture,** and I’d like to think that goal was reached.  I also only made one request to Matthew this time around for the piano part, and that was for him to do the palm glissando during this section to maximum the impact of the glissando, so that helped hide our shortcomings :D.

In an arrangement where I let a lot of thoughts through, I think this part was my **absolute** favorite.  It was also inspired by one of my absolute favorite piano quintet/vocal performances ever.  If you have the time, I encourage you to listen to it in its entirety, because I do play it back quite frequently.  I like it so much, I’m putting as an embed video for y’all to stare at.  But the specific part that I drew inspiration from for the gliss was <a href="https://youtu.be/6f41_ZYJDsU?t=258">here</a>.

Oh, and if y’all don’t like ending stories on a sour note, no worries.  Little Mermaid ended up being a very valuable lesson to me.  A month after my failure that is Little Mermaid, another friend of mine suggested that I apply for a job position that I didn’t have confidence in meeting the requirements.  But **my friend was confident in me, and I remembered the last time I didn’t trust in my friend’s confidence in me, so I thought that this time, I’d see it through the end instead of chickening out.**  The result of that is that **I will be moving up to the Bay Area again this upcoming August to start a new-ish career at a company that I highly regard!**  Woo!  Learn from y’all mistakes guys, continual growth will keep your adventures exciting.  Just thought I’d tangent over into my career life for a bit, since I promised y’all last time that I’d let y’all know (and also I guess end up promoting my other personal website (<a href="/blog/2020/06/15/one-step-four-years-in-the-making.html">Linky link to the post in question</a>).

# Vibe #5: One (On'?) Unified Voice

Alright, let’s get back on track.  This one’s the last one.  We on the home stretch guys.

A key issue that I have found over the past year is that the interactions in the strings tended to get drowned out in the collective sound of the band.  It goes back to what I always say:  it ends up sounding like it’s saying a whole lot of something, but a whole lot of nothing.  **The delicacy in the arrangements was not translating in the actual worship session.**

So we gotta adapt.  How can we fix this?  Well, the best way to do it would be in having a good, proper mix.  But since that wasn’t going to happen, perhaps then, the musicians can do something on their side to help the situation.

And so, in my little music research, I guess I came up with the thought, “what if I just treat the strings as a singular voice, instead of separate voices?”  I recalled that the introduction in Anchored worked out pretty powerfully, and I recalled that our music intern said he really liked our arrangement of Oceans for praise night (but we weren’t actually playing an arrangement, we were all just playing the chords together :D).

So, I hadn’t tried it deliberately before, but there was evidence to suggest that it may work out.  I also thought this was a perfect opportunity to try, because **a lot of country vibin’ only has a singular voice for the string** (whether it be a single violin, or single cello, etc.).  Since I ain’t just going to tell the homies to pack their bags for one song, I figured it would be a good chance for me to try writing the string parts as if they were a singular unit.

<figure class="align-center">

    </audio>
    <figcaption><i>Excerpt 9: String Parts Aligning Rhythmically to Deliver a Unified Voice in the Chorus</i></figcaption>
</figure>

So uh, yeah, if you listen through the arrangement, you’ll notice that the strings always play the same things. Granted, in harmony, but rhythmically, the same things.  There are a few places where I deviate from it, but in general, yeahhh.

Did it work?  Did treating the strings as one singular unified voice help the situation?  I think…kinda.  I think it worked, for this piece, but I don’t think this idea is something that can apply to all worship pieces.  **The benefit of writing in this manner is that the arc of the phrases in the strings is really, really clear.  But if your phrase has nothing to say, then it takes up a bunch of attention for no reason, and it becomes a waste of everyone’s time.**  Fortunately, I don’t think I feel like I wasted everyone’s time this time, but the danger is definitely real.  I think at the end of the day, it is a situational style, and that when the opportunity comes, I will know whether it is a decent idea to use it or not.

# Concluding Remarks

Wow that was a long one, whew.  I had a lot to say this time around, and there’s actually more that I wanted to say, but for the sake of everyone’s sanity, I’ll call it quits here and end on a mm, more personal note, kinda.

When I first started serving at FCBC Walnut last year in AV and worship, I had a bunch of ideas that I felt compelled to bring to the table to elevate worship.  And with every writing and idea, **I felt I was blessed to be able to receive feedback and participate with people in so many different ways.**  I learned how the congregation was reacting to our efforts in writing on a spiritual level, I learned how musicians viewed the things we wrote on a musical level, and I learned how people were inspired to do the things they love in spite of what their day jobs were.  That feedback and interaction drove me forward.

Now, **as a new chapter in NorCal begins soon, I can’t help but feel a little sad to be leaving this.**  If you know me, it takes me a while to really get to know people, and so I only just felt like I was starting to really begin to get to know everyone at FCBC again, even if FCBC was the church that I grew up in.  I don’t know how many more times I will be blessed with the opportunity to serve in worship with FCBC from here on, but every time I have been asked to, it has been a huge blessing for me, and so I only hope that my best efforts I pour out each time writing can be used by God in some sort of way to help others.

Until the next production note!
