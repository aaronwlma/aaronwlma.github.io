excerpt: "Embrace what is given to you so that you can return it back.  In order to be a part of the creative process, creators must take ideas they cherish and loathe and weave them seamlessly together to create something new.  In this production note of Keith and Kristyn Getty’s “Still My Soul, Be Still,” I provide a glimpse into how I take my experiences and apply them into the music that I arrange."

<hr>

I’m not a composer, I just arrange things.

I look at existing ideas and spice it up by “borrowing” other ideas and shoving them in.  I’ve always found that whenever I aimed to be original with my music, I’d fall back to generic and bland sound.  And so, since my college days, **I’ve given up on producing my original sound, and began to look to my inspirations to imitate**, hoping that one day something original would come out from music that I copy.

The string arrangement for “Still My Soul, Be Still” by Keith and Kristyn Getty (and Stuart Townend!) is another result of such “borrowing.”  But, like in college, if turnitin.com does not flag our work for plagiarizing, then I guess we have done a proper job in adapting ideas for our assignment.  Transparency in my musical journey has always been important to me, so **in efforts to inspire those who are lost or don’t know how to start, I wrote for you my three over-arching steps used in the arrangement of “Still My Soul, Be Still”  for worship at FCBC Walnut**—including what I look for when “borrowing”.

# Step #1: Use What is Already There

Let’s be real, it’s 2019.  There has been a lot of people before us.  **Chances are, whatever you’re writing an arrangement for, there’s already material out there for you to get an idea on how you can arrange your piece.**  Fortunately for us at FCBC, Aaron Lee records all of his practice and worship sessions.  If he has played the song with his team before, then the song is likely in the library of recordings that he has available for us.  The bonus for me, specifically, is that Aaron rarely deviates from his recordings, and if he did, he would give prior notice.  That means we can write hyper-specific arrangements for his team.  Awesome.

So, to start our arrangement journey, here’s the recording from 2018 that I had as primary reference (along with the guitar tabs).  I can’t seem to embed time stamped videos, but the song begins at [6:13](https://youtu.be/ej5G-43omJI?t=373)!

There’s two particular instances that I want to point out that helped me get going.  The first is [Aaron’s strum pattern on the last line of each verse](https://youtu.be/ej5G-43omJI?t=393).  **Aaron strums chords rather lightly in the first three phrases of the song, but on the last phrase, he strums the melodic line along with his chords**. The dance around the three phrases into the emphasis on the melodic line was pretty intentional, and so since strings are pretty darn good at emphasizing intent, this was a no-brainer.  If the strings copy the strum pattern (with another kind of lead in dance), then we got a nice accompaniment going here.

The second instance is [cellist Matthew’s last measure before the key change and Aaron’s first beat after the key change](https://youtu.be/ej5G-43omJI?t=489).  Matthew’s note before the landing note in combination with Aaron’s physical motion with the guitar gave me a strong visualization of how I ought to approach the cadence in this interlude.  **The lifting motion of the guitar and the selection of the dominant of the cello suggested that there was a strong tension to resolution action going on, so I mentally noted that everything that happens up to this point has to lead up to the cathartic release of this key change cadence**.  This measure actually ended up being my starting point to the arrangement, and everything else trickled down from this key change.

**So with those two instances drawn from the reference material, I learned that I wanted to build slowly to the key change, and that the verses would alternate between dancing around the lines and an emphasis on the last line**.  They are not particularly new concepts though, as I have tackled the dance-to-emphasis switch-a-roo and key change build-up before in my arrangement of Tommy Walker’s “My Jesus, I Love Thee.”  But by identifying what is already there inside the piece, I can now explore what I can add to the piece!

# Step #2: Pulling from Passion and Discouragement

As I mentioned earlier, writing an original piece is a hard task for me.  The last time I poured hours and hours of my heart and soul out for that, I ended up writing Titanic’s “My Heart Will Go On.”  Whoops.  So if you’re as generic and bland of a human being like I am, **it might benefit you to do lean in on your personal experiences with music** to write something that won’t just go straight into the recycle bin.  Fortunately for me, I’d like to believe my pool of “personal experiences with music” is pretty big, as I’m a particularly emotional guy that seems to resonate with every other song I hear (or I just have no standards).

The first song I’d like to show y’all is [Aimer’s “Koi Wazurai.”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cD0LJcdb5FA)  The string pattern in the bridge of this piece is a pattern that I have been waiting AGES to use (ages as in like a few months).  **I found it to be a brilliant line that adds a strong pulse without pulling attention away from the lyrics.**  So when I slowly began to feel a pulse going in the worship recording demo in Step #1, I instantly was reminded of [the catchy yet useful motif in “Koi Wazurai,”](https://youtu.be/cD0LJcdb5FA?t=189) so I chucked that into the chorus of the arrangement:

<figure class="align-center">

    <figcaption><i>Figure 1: Adaptation of Aimer’s “Koi Wazurai” Into the Chorus of “Still My Soul, Be Still”</i></figcaption>
</figure>

Sometimes this “reminded” feeling doesn’t happen instantly though, and you end up spending hours thinking about what other songs could fit the arrangement.  Fortunately, “Koi Wazurai” was near instant for me in “Still My Soul, Be Still,” so you can imagine how excited I was when things worked out pretty well the first time I adjusted the string pattern to fit the chorus.

While Aimer’s “Koi Wazurai” was a piece that is from a country far, far, away, the next song I want to show y’all, [Coral’s “I’d Like to Be a Bird,”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tRtFOj7kWY) is a piece that actually originates quite close by.  In this piece created by my friend’s friend, **the viola sprinkles in [alternating notes](https://youtu.be/4tRtFOj7kWY?t=88) to create an ambiance that is slightly alluring, yet also mysterious**.  It’s also [re-used again](https://youtu.be/4tRtFOj7kWY?t=205) to catapult the energy of the song to its climax.  Do these accomplishments sound like something I was looking for?  Yes, these were aspects of a piece that I was already looking for in my arrangement of “Still My Soul, Be Still.”  Angie already laid the groundwork by [hinting at the possibility of alternating notes](https://youtu.be/ej5G-43omJI?t=489) sporadically through the piece, so adjusting this musical motif in “I’d Like to Be a Bird” for “Still My Soul, Be Still,” wasn’t too difficult.

</figure>

Again, reaching the point where you say “Aha!  This is a piece that fits well with this arrangement” is really a point you have very little control over.  Sometimes it happens within the first 15 minutes like in this arrangement, or it doesn’t come for a few weeks or months (and then deadlines get pushed or projects get trashed).  But just because you’re a slave to the circumstances, doesn’t mean you can’t be prepared for it.  **Things come more naturally to you if you’re think about them all the time**, so all you have to do is just keep thinking about the music you listen to day in day out. :D

While “Koi Wazurai” was a song that totally got me excited the first time I heard it, “I’d Like to Be a Bird” was actually a song that actually put me pretty down in the dumps at first.  Just knowing that my friends, who also have their own respective day jobs, can produce a work of music like this on the side made me actually feel embarrassed to call myself a musician.  But whether your interactions are positive or negative, there is always something to take away from the experience.  In this case, **I did my best to learn from two songs that brought me both passion and discouragement by taking what they had going for them in their respective pieces and applying that to this arrangement.**

Oh, and just to be clear, I absolutely **love** Coral’s “I’d Like to Be a Bird.”  It just reminds me that I have a lot more that I can learn and do, which is totally overwhelming at times…haha.  I do recommend you [check her out](https://sincerelycoral.com/) if you vibe with her style.

# Step #3: Exercising Restraint and Flair

Alright, so now we got the peak that we want to build toward, the manner to which we want to approach the verses, and two major musical motifs that we…borrowed…from two pieces that have impacted us greatly.  Great.  We got lots of pieces now on the table.  All that’s left is to put the puzzle together and voila!  We should get something.  Sometimes though, **once everything’s put together, the ideas might not be all that…cohesive or applicable.**  I think once you have reached that point, digging in to the arrangement and making adjustments based on flow and feeling is particularly useful.

<figure class="align-center">
    <img src="/images/2019/10/22/figure-3-adaptation-of-aimers-koi-wazurai-into-the-chorus-of-still-my-soul-be-still-again.png" alt="">
    <figcaption><i>Figure 3: Adaptation of Aimer’s “Koi Wazurai” Into the Chorus of “Still My Soul, Be Still”…Again</i></figcaption>
</figure>

So, as a reminder, here’s the adapted musical motif from Aimer’s “Koi Wazurai.”  It’s actually painfully forward, and if we were to use this every time in the chorus, the effect of the strong emphasis will get bled out.  It might even start to get a little obnoxious with how strongly the strings play the phrase.

<figure class="align-center">
    <img src="/images/2019/10/22/figure-4-modification-to-the-aimer-motif-to-soften-the-impact-in-early-chorus-iterations.png" alt="">
    <figcaption><i>Figure 4: Modifications to the Aimer Motif to Soften the Impact in Early Chorus Iterations</i></figcaption>
</figure>

So in order to restrain that a bit, we make modifications to that motif to soften the emphasis.  This serves two purposes for us.  First, it gently sneaks the motif into the piece so that, when the strong emphasis happens, it’s not a brand new concept.  Second, it drives the piece forward, as with each iteration of the chorus, something more is added.  With that “something more,” I was hoping that it would encourage the congregation and worship team to want to give more as well.  So, **by making restraining modifications to earlier iterations of the Aimer motif, we heighten the impact of the final statement while simultaneously keep the arrangement from being stale.**

While we exercised restraint on Aimer’s motif, we actually exercised a little bit of flair when we take a look at how we used Coral’s motif.  Coral’s piece only had the alternating notes during her select portions of the song.  However, **just alternating between notes during the interlude did leave the interlude relatively…empty, and so to fill that emptiness a bit, we can add bit of flair by including a melodic element to the interlude.**

<figure class="align-center">
    <img src="/images/2019/10/22/figure-5-spicing-things-up-by-adding-some-flair-to-the-interlude.png" alt="">
    <figcaption><i>Figure 5: Spicing Things Up by Adding Some Flair to the Interlude</i></figcaption>
</figure>

Now, I think it’s important right now to remind you to be considerate of the team you serve with in your arrangements.  With our usual pianist Chloe, I have the ability to fill every nook and cranny of the piece, as Chloe does not fill or flourish on the piano very often.  However, our pianist this week was Brian, and I know Brian fills at every opportunity he gets a chance to (I do use his fills as reference materials often after all).  So, by taking the melodic line here, I’ve basically taken away what Brian normally would do and told him to “find your space somewhere else.”  This could be particularly rude or demanding, so **be conscious of your team’s musicians when you decide to add flair and try to find a compromise where everyone can be happy**.  Thanks Brian, for allowing us to take up the space!

Oh, and fun fact, this melodic line comes from a piece I (attempted) to write back in my music composition course in HK, so I actually pulled something out of the recycle bin!  I’m pretty sure I borrowed this idea from somewhere too, but I have forgotten the source at this point.  Sorry, original author.

# Concluding Remarks

Once you’ve made enough modifications by adding flair or restraining existing ideas, you should be pretty much done (debatable)!  **You can now step away from your arranging software of choice and take a break to rest your ears.**  When you come back with fresh ears, you can identify what you liked and what you didn’t.  For the things you liked, you can remember.  For the things you didn’t like, you can go through the steps again to modify it until you are satisfied.  Or when you give up.  Up to you.  My professor has always said that **compositions are never finished, just abandoned**.  So just keep going until one of the two happens…

Oh, and here’s the final thought that I feel compelled to share.  Being raised in a Christian household and a conservative environment had left child-me with the impression that service and worship to Jesus was not supposed to be fun (we as the congregation are sometimes like the graveyard of Qin Xi Huang, man).  Writing arrangements for worship for me, though, is fun.  I’d like to believe that by living in HK, TW, and SF for a period of time has opened up my world view a little bit more, but you can imagine the tiny bit of guilt I was feeling when I was writing and started getting excited about how the arrangement was panning out to be.  *“Oh no, what a sinful man I am!  How could I be getting excited and having fun over something **sensual** like **music** and not reading the Bible 500 times!”*  But it is at those times that I reflect upon my Christian testimony and get reminded that, time and time again, **music has been one of the strongest avenues for me to draw near to God, and if that’s the case, I really ought not to turn away from it, let alone enjoying it.**

It has always been a huge blessing for me in life to be so strongly moved by music, and I really don’t think that was something that was willed by me or created by me.  When I receive feedback that the things I write allow people to experience music in a similar fashion as me, I always find it to be quite the miracle.  **None of what I bring to the table is my own, I just take the things given to me and put them together in another way.**  In a way, it’s always been nice to see how much of a failure trying to create original sound has been.  I think that by accepting that I have nothing to offer, by being open to the musical experiences given to me, and by returning those experiences in the music that comes through me, I am constantly reminded of the concept of saving grace that I have been drawn to follow.  This concept, though, is probably a life-long effort to nurture, and so I can only trust that I will continue to persevere with it to the very end, both in music and in my spiritual walk.

Hopefully you enjoyed this arrangement break down!  It got a little long-winded, but please look forward to the next one!
