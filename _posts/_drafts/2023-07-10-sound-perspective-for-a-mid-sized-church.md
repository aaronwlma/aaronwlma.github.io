excerpt: "Three mantras to guide you in your adventures toward bettering the worship experience in a mid-sized church."
---

If you attend a church with anything between 100 to 1000 attendees, chances are, your church is using amplified sound for its worship service.  If you attend a church with an AV team comprised of volunteers, chances are, your church struggles in producing a consistent house mix that satisfies everyone. If you attend a church post-COVID, chances are, recordings (whether livestreams or worship tapes) have lit your worship team's interest in making the house mix better.

Striving for excellence is good.  After all, who *doesn't* want a better worship experience?  There is nothing inherently wrong with that goal and direction.  However, before the worship ministries collectively embark on that journey to improve, it is important for the ministries to visit home to lock in what success looks like and what it will cost to get there.  To help with that, 

# The Status Quo

### The 90%
The Sunday service workflow for many AV teams at mid-sized churches is usually pretty straightforward:
1. Setup (plug everything into your soundboard, including instruments, mics, speakers, and monitors)
2. Line Check (verify that signals are coming in where they expect, and going out to where they expect)
3. Gain Stage (set faders and baseline the gain values on the mixer to provide sufficient headroom for both music and AV teams)
4. Sound Check (make the sound in the house pretty)
5. Run Service (throw faders and mute/unmute things in a timely manner during the service)

Four out of the five (1-3, 5) are quite straight-forward and quite teachable.  It is relatively simple to ramp someone up on how to setup (plug things here and there), how to line check (do you see green bars and hear things), how to gain stage (is it loud enough), and how to run the Sunday service (press unmute when the pastor walks up).  This is traditionally why AV teams, when looking for help, will advertise with the phrase, "no experience required."

And for the most part, this is correct.  The majority of the work can be taught, and anyone can quickly go from zero-to-hero in a few months.  Better yet, it offers a win-win situation where the AV ministry can get the help they need while simultaneously offering church members with no experience an opportunity to serve.

If an AV team has a team of members that can execute on these four things, and a streamlined process to onboard new members to execute on these four things, they are already 90% of the way there to excellence.  This is a great score--it is a passing grade.  Executing on this 90% is the fundamental, uncompromisable need that a mid-sized church asks from its AV team.

### The 10%
The remaining 10% is the cherry-on-top:  sound check.  This involves making the resulting amplified sound "pretty."  This is something that everyone will nod their heads in agreement on as something that is good and should be done; we all like pretty things after all.  But when the rubber hits the road, this 10% will very often lend its way to be the subject of heated discussion at many mid-sized churches that aim to add the cherry.

Worse yet, tackling the 10% often happens before the 90% is rock-solid, and AV teams end up constantly plugging holes in a ship that is ever doomed to eventually sink.  Over-zealous EQs lend its way to an errant feedback loop, over-doctored signals lend its way to a disingenuous representation of the music, and over-enthusiastic individuals lend its way to unintentionally burning out other members of the ministry.

Unlike the 90%, the 10% is not something that can be taught in just a few months.  The 10% requires members to learn both complex technicalities and general musicality.  The 10% *also* requires other members to *teach* both complex technicalities and general musicality *well*.  And so, with those high bars, the 10% can very well take years and decades to reach a point where the ministry is *kiinda* satisfied with their resulting mix.  Learning the 90%, at best, is only just halfway point when it comes to mastery of producing a good worship mix.

This is why it is good to refer to sound check as the 10% for a mid-sized church with an AV team comprised of volunteers.  It is not the fundamental need of a church of this size, and it is not the fundamental expectation of a "no experienced required" ministry.  It is a practice that requires experience, and it is a practice that has a large cost to achieving.  However, when the worship ministries are ready and willing, the healthy approach to fulfilling the 10% is noticeable and undeniably takes the worship experience to the next level.  It is the cherry-on-top for an ice cream sundae (service).
