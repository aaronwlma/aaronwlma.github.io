Welp uh, happy Wednesday?! Lol. Woops. I was debating if I should have named this post “Weekly Roundup 14.5” since it’s basically past the middle of the next week already, but uh, I’d like to not set a precedent of openly acknowledging the delaying of my posts. If my past history of skipping classes has taught me anything, it is that if I do it once, I’ll end up doing it twice, or thrice, or…a lot more times. Lol.

I started feeling a bit of a (dare I say) writer’s block starting around Weekly Roundup 10, and it’s been a slight struggle to put something up each week since then. When things are fresh and new, you have a bunch of ideas you want to explore and present, and so that enthusiasm and content drives you forward for a while.

But if you do it enough times, what comes shortly after is that it’s no longer fresh, or new. All the immediate ideas at the forefront of your mind are expended, and you somehow find yourself thinking “what can I do to present something new,” instead of “what do I want to say this time“. You lose your initial direction, and to me, that is the real starting point of any sort of endeavor. The true nature of dedication, passion, and character really comes forward at this time, when you (or others) require yourself to do something over and over again in a way that is fresh, even when you don’t want to. But uh, yeah, how’s that for an unrelated intro? This is a thought that I hold in relatively high regard, and since it does seem like I have now entered that stage when it comes to casual writing, I figure it was a nice thought to bring to light. Not the topic of today’s conversation though, lol.

In my manager one-on-one this week, my manager let me know that, as expected, I am meeting all the expectations that they have for me. He said that the distribution of DPE members in that pool was fairly large, but in actuality I was more on the upper end of that pool (can I feed my ego and consider this as meeting the Asian expectation of being above average?). To better understand the situation that I am in (not that it mattered to the task at hand), I asked my manager what it was that I was not exhibiting that people who were exceeding expectations were.

Small details aside, it boiled down to ownership and proactivity. Or at least, the positively-connotated variants of those essences. Essentially, what those candidates did often that I did not, was that they would “identify flaws and shortcomings surrounding their project environment, and actively go in and revise them to be better.”

Something that I learned too painfully well at Panasonic was that, if there’s something wrong, chances are, you yourself have done something wrong. When something is wrong, asking yourself “what did I screw up” has time and time provided me insight and action items that has overwhelmingly been more productive than blaming technology, co-workers, society, etc. It lets me solve issues before they come up, and it lets me make sure that when I get help, I get productive and useful help.

So, with that idea in mind, I also did run across a few…”issues”…during my project. “Issues” is double quoted, because I don’t really consider them issues at all. The original environment was created with certain things in mind, and certain things to avoid. With the introduction of my contribution, the “issues” that came up are more so because I scoped my portion of the project insufficiently, and there are a few moving parts that don’t click too well into the grand scheme of things.

So when I hit that point in my project, I actively put some thought in to how I could extend my code in to the existing code base, without tampering with what has already been in production for a while. “What is the least invasive approach that allows me to get all the goals that I want, without shaking up a solid foundation just to accommodate for that?” If that exists, I do not touch what is already there.

But it seems like that’s no bueno. Or at least, it seems like those who are killing it do that, and my honest initial reaction is to question whether or not they truly understand the environment they work in. Too many times have I seen engineers and people quickly blame technology, or hypothetical people (like I just did) for the problems they experience. “It’s not that I don’t understand the situation, or that I’m incompetent. No, whoever wrote this before me didn’t know what they were doing.” “You know technology, it’s unreliable. It’s not that I didn’t bother to learn how to properly use it, no, it’s just these things are not reliable.“

Don’t get me wrong, these statements are not always untrue though. But it is not a statement that new hires, or novices, should ever resort to. Is it really that easy to get that level of proficiency in anything in 12 weeks? If there is less invasive solution than declaring the previous things trash without compromising your objectives, you should go with that. Not being able to see that, for me, is more a sign of an engineer is lacking the ability to hold an open mind to all sorts of possibilities. Things have to adhere to their world view, otherwise, it is wrong.

I did bring up to my manager that I was consciously avoiding tampering with the existing code base though. If there is anything I learned from Panasonic and from the beginnings of this job (and from me hypocritically getting irritated at people who have thoughts but not vocalizing it), responding politely and respectfully to these sorts of thoughts will bring you more insight, and so I vocalized what I thought about the idea of fixing things beyond my domain.

And my manager responded that he acknowledged that there is definitely two approaches here. There is the approach to go in and fix beyond the constraints of your domain, so that things are (relatively) better, and there is the approach to respect the lines and code within the space that you can control. He went on to say that neither extremes is good, and how strongly an engineer leans is dependent on feedback, especially from their manager. It is the job of the manager to help the engineer with those sorts of things. And right now, what he has observed in regards to taking me to the “killing it/exceeds expectations” level, would mean that I should be more aggressive in fixing things beyond the constraints of my project–to go harder in on that, and if I become too aggressive with that, he will let me know to tone it down.

So, uh, great. I have my action item for when this week long work break ends. Don’t work around problems that aren’t mine, go in and take ownership of those problems. Got it. This is a rather…foreign territory for me, but hey, if there’s anything I learn from my nightly Genshin dailies, it is that foreign places are great to explore, so I will do that. I’m sure I will fumble and bumble around, as in all things that I do, but it goes back to reminding myself to lean in on the support from my team and manager. To trust that they will chime in when things start heading south. When that time comes, I can tilt myself back over to the more “conservative” approach.

Over time, I’ll probably eventually hover around a position that optimizes the pros and cons of both sides, but I don’t think there is anything like “landing” on it. Things continue to change and time continues to move on, and so there really is not going to be a point where I can say “alright, I’m there now.” Instead, I think it what ends up holding constant is the swaying from side to side for the rest of career, and it’s important is that I don’t get seasick from this, but rather, that I recognize the ebb and flow, and enjoy riding the waves of this voyage.

Welp, since I have delayed this post so painfully late, these pictures are all from last week. I’ll still post this upcoming Sunday with my week-long break shenanigans! 😀

[2020.11.17] I was only waiting for this desk for 2 months, but the standing desk is here! Now my workstation can finally be retrofitted with more…permanent additions. Eventually 🙂

[2020.11.17] When I first moved to the Bay Area in 2015, I lived on the ground floor in a studio with my window facing the side of a building, and so I really disliked the rain (there was a time where there was a bit of flooding that happened and my carpet got wet). But this time around, it seems like I will get to enjoy the rain a little more when it happens 🙂

[2020.11.18] Weather getting chilly, so of course it is tong yuan season lol.

[2020.11.20] It is also Christmas season! Woo, my favorite month of the year approaches.

[2020.11.21] T’was supposed to go down to SoCal to celebrate the dad’s birthday last weekend, but cause of the recent COVID spikes, our family opted out of the gathering. So this was our compromise.

[2020.11.22] While the work from home orders due to COVID are generally an introvert’s dream, I don’t think I swing hard enough into that category to be able to say that things have been sparkles and glitter. Been missing the opportunities to freely do nature things with nature homies, so it’s nice to be able to go out for brisk walks once in a while!
