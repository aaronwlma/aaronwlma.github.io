There was a rather polarizing distinction this week between the good and the bad (in life, and in the DPE program), but since I have said before that I choose positivooty, today I’d like to highlight on an idea that has really come forward the past two weeks. I am guessing you have read the title by now, so you are already aware, lol.

Yes, today I would like to highlight privilege. That is, I am privileged. I alluded to it a bit in my week 3 post, but I want to iterate again: Unfairness has been favorable to me, and I am a privileged individual for that.

So why do I bring that up now, in week 4. Aside from one of my friends bringing that word up recently, I did feel that this week wasn’t the smoothest sailing. In the fourth week of Bootcamp, our content breaks into a focus area groups that are more geared toward our specific roles, and I guess the best way to say is that since we know our teams already, some of the material doesn’t actually directly apply. The task that was assigned to me was up a level as well, and so I admit I have been struggling a little bit on it.

But not because I don’t think I can figure it out, but because I am hesitant to ask for help. Now, in a typical situation pre-covid, if I had reached this point, I would get up out of my (Herman Miller Aeron) chair (assuming I wasn’t already standing at my standing desk), walk (or maybe bike or shuttle) over to the person responsible for this task, sit down at his desk (or ask if they would like to use a conference room), and say “I’m having trouble understanding this task. Here, this is what I have so far, how would I approach this part here?”

The benefit of doing this that it’s a casual, friendly, sustainable way to not only pick the brains of some brilliant individual, but also to create a connection of mutual help that will make your work just a bit more pleasant in the long run. But alas, it is virtual, and so reaching out, and typing “hey, I’m having trouble understanding this task. Here, this is what I have so far, how would I approach this part here?” is not an impossible task, but a more difficult for sure (at least, for me).

With the harder task, the less applicable content, and the fourth week of working from home crashing in this week, well, I guess the best way to put is that lethargy and grumbling were definitely things on my mind. “I wish the office was open, this experience would’ve been off the WALLS man.” “Sigh, I have to buy groceries again, but I have to basically do 5 days work in 4 huh?” “I wish I could converse with my cohort members and team members, then I can form some really good relationships and learn so much more.” “What the heck is the sky up to?”

You’ll see pictures later in this post, but this weekend I also went touring my future apartment (aka, home for the next year). When I walked into one of them, looked around, soaked in the vibes, I think I had a bit of a sudden realization there:

“Hold up, this is expensive.”

Expensive? What’s expensive? What does it mean to be expensive? Dollar value? Oh right, the dollar value is hella expensive, I wouldn’t be able to afford this at all back in Panasonic. What? What’s that? The year’s rent is actually already paid for by the sign on bonus? And I still wouldn’t have to worry, because I have a savings buffer that can cover it all?

Audience of me, that is nutty. That is absolutely nutty. I walk around and talk about it like it’s no big deal, but it is a big deal. I am compensated so well, and I’m given a years time to learn. Free food? Walking around on campus? Building new relationships? Are they great? Yeah. But man, I am already way, way, beyond what I deserve, and what I need.

So these…bad stuff…I have. Having a hard time connecting, needing to grocery shop, staying motivated alone. Are they valid? Yeah. But, am I unsatisfied? Heck no. I have every resource available to me, because I am privileged. With the privilege unfairly given to me, I want to use it to the utmost to not offend those who aren’t as lucky. I hope that my recognition of privilege spurs me to try a bit harder. Make that uncomfortable ping for help. Make that inconvenient grocery run. Take the effort to see and meet more people. Don’t shy from the difficult, because thats offensive to those who are less privileged.

So! In light of the contrastingly disastrous Sunday I had, I think that, going into week 5, I want to keep in mind those who are not on the privileged side of the coin at this stage of life. What is the only honorable way I can conduct myself in privilege to not disrespect them? Just gotta keep recognizing the privilege and keep on putting myself out there beyond what privilege has offered for me to pitch a tent and settle in. Be diligent and work hard to encourage the ones that you, the privileged, have been privileged to gain their attention. 🙂

TL-DR: Got a lot going well for me right now, so I gotta keep a good posture to avoid offending those who have it a little bit harder on them right now. Maybe I would end up being an encouragement to them, and bonus, I can be a better version of yourself with each iteration too.
