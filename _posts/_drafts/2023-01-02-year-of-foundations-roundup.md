excerpt: "I declared a theme at the beginning of 2022 to guide myself into being more productive with the time that I have.  Since 2023 has now begun, this post summarizes what went well, what went expected, and what could have went better when it came to operating around my theme of 'The Year of Foundations'."

My good friend Matthew gifted me a CGP Grey Theme Journal for Christmas back in 2021.  This theme journal system is relatively simple--set a theme for the year, and then make decisions/plan goals that align with that theme.  There was a lot of things I wanted to get done in 2022 (and beyond), and so I decided to give theme journaling a try.  It's been 12 months since then, so I think it's the right time to wrap up 2022 by reflecting on what went well, what went as expected, and what didn't work in theme-ing around 2022.

# The Theme and Ideal Outcomes

**The theme that I came up with for 2022 was "The Year of Foundations".**  Specifically, this is what I wrote down to describe it:

> Over the past few years, things have shifted and evolved in a way that has me trying to do everything, but has ended up with me doing a lot of things poorly and nothing well.  This year is to recognize the most prominent things in life, and establish a foundation for each one to allow it to sustainably grow.

In other words, everything I was doing in life was messy, and I wanted to add structure to it to make things work more effortlessly, efficiently, and pleasurably.

As such, these were the following outcomes that I had penned down as things I wanted to see in 2022, along with their respective priorities and ratings:
1. **(P1/MM)** A stable platform to release all Aaron things (aaronwlma.github.io)
2. **(P0/MA)** A constant flow of collaborative music creation (TaBi-MiX)
3. **(P1/MM)** Finance funneling is deliberate planned (home buying, stocks, retirement, monthly costs)
4. **(P0/EE)** Exercise is routine, consistent, and painless (~5/7 days a week)
5. **(P2/NS)** "Be a guitarist":  Reach a confidence point where guitar can be considered an instrument in my arsenal
6. **(P2/MS)** Data Consolidation:  Digitize assets and organize in an understandable manner

For the folks unfamiliar with engineering performance reviews, here's a list of the definitions for priorities and ratings:

**Priorities:**
- **P0**: Must do, the world explodes if it doesn't get done.
- **P1**: Best to do now, otherwise the world may run into a situation where it explodes in the near future.
- **P2**: Nice to have, do this if you already prevented the world from exploding as this will keep the world intact.

**Ratings:**
- **EE**: Exceeds expectations.  You had expectations about how the results will be, and it went beyond that.
- **MA**: Meets all.  You had expectations about how the results will be, and it was exactly that.
- **MM**: Meets most.  You had expectations about how the results will be, and it did most of that.
- **MS**: Meets some.  You had expectations about how the results will be, and it met just some of it.
- **NS**: Needs support.  You had expectations about how the results will be and good lord you dropped the ball.  Send halp.

This six ideal outcomes can be summarized effectively in the four categories--health, music, finance, and data.  For summary sake, let's go through each one of these four categories and reflect on how each of them ended up relative to their priorities and ratings.

# Health: Exceeds Expectations

> - **(P0/EE)** Exercise is routine, consistent, and painless (~5/7 days a week)

Let's start with what exceeded my expectations:  Health.

This one shouldn't be too much of a surprise, as I literally had [a whole post dedicated to exercise yesterday](https://aaronwlma.github.io/blog/2022/12/31/recap-on-running-1000-miles-in-2022.html).  But for folks familiar with engineering performance reviews, this one ended up being an EE (exceeds expectations), which means that there is something here that came out of this that I was not expecting for myself, in a good way.

I had reasonable expectations that I would make effort all year to get an exercise routine going, but I did not expect that by doing so that I would birth a new portion of my personal identity surrounding running.  While it's probably pretty easy to point at January 2022 to December 2023 and point towards the average heart rate during runs and average distance per run as the metric of success, I think the true indicator of success here is actually how I think about running.

It started off as "don't be fat, exercise" and ended as "I need and want to go for a run".  It started off as checking off a box on my whiteboard when I completed a run to me actively looking for running events, places, and equipment.  I discovered a new community and space that was exciting and I wanted to dig deeper into it.  This desire eventually overrode the original motivation to "not be fat" and turned into a genuine hobby that I don't think is seasonal.

Because of this, I think I exceeded my own personal expectations when it came to setting a solid foundation for managing health through exercise, and so I think this definitely went well.

# Music:  Meets All
