excerpt: "In efforts to improve my physical health in 2022, I set out to establish a regular exercise routine in early January.  Fast forward 12 months, as 2022 comes to an end and 2023 starts, I managed to clock in 1000 miles of running in 2022.  This post is a summary of what happened, a recap of notable runs, and a blurb on future milestones."

As 2021 came to a close, I decided that 2022 would be the year to shed some weight, and I jotted this down as a goal in my theme journal for 2022 back in January:

> Exercise is routine, consistent, and painless (~5/7 days per week)
> <cite class="align-right">--From My Theme Journal for 2022</cite>

Fast forward 12 months, and here I am with 1000 miles of running logged on Strava.  I suppose that wasn't the original goal, but the spirit of the original exists in it, and so that's good I suppose.  Regardless, I consider this quite the mile(heh)stone personally, and so I figure it would be nice if I put some writing in stone by documenting some of the important bits of this 1000 mile journey.

# The Results of 2022

Basically, I ran 1000 miles in 2022, lol:

  <figcaption><i>Strava official summary contains walks too, hence the additional 16 miles.  Apparently I'm top 2% this year!</i></figcaption>
</figure> 

More specifically, I roughly ran 80-100 miles a month, 15-25 miles a week, 3-4 miles a weekday, 6-8 miles a Saturday:

</figure> 

An interesting note that can be seen on the graph is that I didn't start with 20-25 miles per week from the get go.  I slowly scaled upwards from month-to-month.  I did this to observe how my body was responding to the longer-term consequences of running daily-ish, and to make sure I don't burn myself out or hurt myself permanently to put me out of commission (it's a marathon, not a sprint).  Running to me is something I want to do for a long, long time, and so I take no shortcuts here and make sure to dial it back as needed.

It was about halfway through the year that I saw that I was on track to hit 1000 miles before the end of the year, and so I loosely set that as a milestone to aim for, and I managed to hit it!  1000.2 miles with 0 days to spare...lol.  Got dangerously close to missing, whew.

# The Notable Runs of 2022

In the 1000 miles, I managed to run in three events this year.  I also managed to run around for fun internationally in London, as well as give "trail running" a try:

### [Grand Teton 5K](https://www.strava.com/activities/7250711098/overview)
My first (of hopefully many) Vacation Race's event.  I really love these events because it enables you to go out and explore the amazing national parks the US has to offer.  Everyone at these events are always in really high spirits too, and it's contagious so I love them.  I ran this 5K by myself since my homies were running the Grand Tetons Half-Marathon, but they came out to support me and that was definitely heard on the run.

### [San Francisco Marathon 10K](https://www.strava.com/activities/7521752258/overview)
This one was my first 10K event.  I had ran 10K+ every weekend in my local area for a while prior to this event, so I wasn't too concerned about the run.  I was actually more concerned the logistics of getting in and out of SF, since this was my first solo event where I had no friends or family around to support.  I managed to get my 10K PR (that I have yet to beat), and the overall experience was relatively pivotal for me in giving me confidence that, if needed, I can do running events on my own and it would be OK.  Hoping that I can do the SF Half-Marathon next year!  Fingers crossed.

### [Santa Claus Run for a Cause 10K](https://www.strava.com/activities/8259947499/overview)
I started running after I watched my siblings run.  My sister got a head start and ran in a few events prior, and my brother soon got into it afterwards.  From there, my brother has done some pretty amazing races, and I always had the front seat to that as the designated driver and equipment carrier for the events.  Eventually I wanted to join in on their stories (as well as not be fat), and so I began my own journey.  My dad was no different, and he began to go at it recently as well.

I guess I say all that because this run was the first run that the four of us (the sister, the brother, the father, the me) got a chance to run together.  Together, the children of the family got to run alongside the dad and watch him get his 10K PR.  My 1-year old nephew even got his own medal for walking 10 feet across the finish line at this event.  It's the same medal as mine, so I think the event coordinators are being a little bit unfair here.

### [Running Around Hyde Park in London](https://www.strava.com/activities/7337626171/overview)
This one was notable to me because it was signaled to me how important running was becoming in my life.  At this point, I preferred to run in my dedicated running shoes, and so for me to take up a substantial amount of space in my carry-on to bring my running equipment across the Atlantic Ocean for a business trip and carve out time to run was pretty significant.  These runs also cracked me up a little because I would run at stupid hours (~4-5am) due to jet lag.  I figured it never hurt to give an open invite to my coworkers to join me, and so I did.  Not surprisingly, there was a relatively unanimous "nah I'm good" in that chat, lol.

### [Trail Running at Crystal Cove State Park](https://www.strava.com/activities/8282964240/overview)
Running in events and around the local area is great and all, but I really enjoy the outdoors too, and staring at pavement, cars, and buildings during the runs is not exactly scenic.  I would love to combine nature with my runs, and that's exactly what trail running can offer.  That being said, trail running is really a completely different ball game that I am not too sure how far I can go with it.  Still, before the year ended, I wanted to give the trail a trial, and I ran this 7-miler (while the homies ran the 10-mile larger loop).  It was definitely a lot harder, particularly on the inclines and declines, but the nature along the way was very much enjoyed.

# The Milestones for 2023

The 1000 miles over 278 days in 2022 has answered one very important question in my head: Can I run regularly, habitually, and sustainably in a controlled manner?  The 1000 miles has given me evidence to suggest that I can, and so with the habits firmly in place, I want to take my running to the next level and be closer to the events and nature that I enjoy.

As such, these are the rough goals that I have planned for 2023:

### 1. Run a half marathon
The longest distance that I ran in 2022 was 9.03 miles.  I *think* I can probably power through another 4.07 miles to get to the needed 13.1 as needed, but I want to do this right.  Most of the nice races (e.g. Vacation Races, international ones, etc.) have half-marathons but not 10Ks, and so I think I would like to be able to get to a point where I can sustainably run, say, 3-4 half-marathons a year in 2024.  The first step to that is to complete my first half-marathon, so I'm hoping that I can complete one in 2023.

### 2. Figure out if trail running is a stupid idea or not
Like I mentioned earlier, it would be nice to be able to combine my love for the outdoors with my love of being part of the running community.  I am not sure that I have the physical capabilities to do this in a reasonable manner.  However, I was also not too sure about my physical capabilities when I resumed my running shenanigans this year, but here I am with 1000 more miles.  

I'd like to take some time in 2023 to see what it takes to do trail running sustainably, and see if that's something that I could do too.  A pipe dream for now, but it would be nice if one day I could do the Tour du Mont Blanc in Switzerland/France/Italy over the course of like, 10-12 days.  But that shall remain a pipe dream until I figure out how much trail running I could *actually* do given my limitations.

### 3. Maintain 1000 miles
This one shouldn't be too difficult, hopefully.  1000 so far seems to be a nice number (roughly 80 miles a month, ~20 miles a week), so it would be nice to be able to maintain that.  I do forsee some obstacles happening in 2023 through that will put me out of commission for a bit, but hopefully I can still hit the 1000 in 2023 too.

# Final Thoughts

I really consider the 1000th mile in 2022 to be a milestone and not the finish line.  The journey is really supposed to be 1% finished here, and I'm personally excited to start working towards the other things in the running space that I want to be a part of.

Through running, I am personally learning a lot about my body, my tendencies, my poor habits, my good habits, my strengths, my weaknesses, and the people around me, amongst many, many other things.  I am extremely glad that I managed to get the 1000 miles out this year, and I consider it to be my greatest accomplishment in 2022...even though this is not particularly eventful relative to the behemoths I am surrounded by, lol.  But hey, any amount of distance is commendable, really.  It is always already more than what you would have done had you not laced up and let the foot hit the road.

And lastly, on a final, final fun note:  After all these shenanigans, I paid a visit to my arch-nemesis, the scale, and mustered the courage to, once again, step on it.  I figured that I deserved to see the fruits of my labor, and the results of me heehaw-ing like a donkey every day against the original problem.  The results were...nothing really notable, lol.  I suppose I better lay off the DoorDashing in 2023 :(.

Happy New Year!!
