excerpt: "To celebrate the upcoming resurrection of Jesus this week, I, too, resurrect an old project from the grave. I revisit a production that I started in 2018 with high hopes and aspirations, but ended with disappointment. Discouragement and encouragement are two sides of the same coin, and so in this note, I tangentially talk about how the junky stuff I do in the past motivates me to make more junky stuff in the present."

I found it slightly amusing that I did a cover on “28” just a few weeks prior, and now here I am talking about a cover on a song that is titled “17 Sai” (Age Seventeen).  In my “28” production note, I mention how time just seems to whiz by.  A lot changed between 21 and 27, but when I look back even further to when I was 17, it’s quite amusing to see how much more drastic the change is.  How drastic, you may ask?

Well, to show the drastic transformation between foolish brute and stunning sage, here’s some when-Aaron-was-17 trivia and thoughts for y’all to get a better idea of what young-Aaron was like:

- Didn’t bother thinking about a major in the four years of high school, ended up arbitrarily tickin’ the “Physics” check box because it sounded cool (and then subsequently changed his major 6 times between Freshman year and graduation (the last switch happened 3.5 years into college)).
- Adamantly believed he wouldn’t go to UC Irvine because that is where his older sister went, and he is better than that (and then ended up going to UC Irvine).
- Rocked this breath-taking hairdo, courtesy of the DMV:

Man that was a rough list to write.  If you know me, I always struggle at times writing about my past.  There is just SOMETHING about reminiscing on your glory days that painfully reminds you how much you have already left your prime.  The pain of realizing how far you have fallen can be too much sometimes.  Welp, at the least, with all the haircut places closed right now due to the stay-at-home, perhaps I can relive my glory days by letting my hair grow out again…

Alright, great.  Jokes are out of the system now, time to be productive with this production note.  I actually don’t remember where I was going with that, probably had something to do with trying to connect my past as a seventeen year old to the song title “17 Sai.”  Either way, I think the intro is now beyond saving, so here’s a two-wheeled Pusheen segue:

# The Discouraging Dying Cat (Not Pusheen)

So this production of “17 Sai” was actually a production that I did in 2018.  **Two years ago, I had a fleeting desire to streamline a quick process to do more violin covers, and so I busted out the MIDI controller and started punching away at some synths to start.**  I even got my friend Matt involved (as always) to take care of the cajon and piano lines.  He promptly supplied me those files (crazy, right?), and I put it all together annnnndddd…

I hated it.

Specifically though, I hated my violin.  I have a very strong love/hate relationship with the violin.  I think that the violin is an absolutely phenomenal instrument.  **No other instrument can compare to its ability to facilitate a musician’s expression, and so many strong things can be said through the absurdly delicate yet sweet response of the instrument.**

**Yet 20 years of violin experience is SO much less useful than possibly any other instrument.**  You learn to be nothing but the star of the show.  You prime yourself to only think monophonically.  You don’t properly learn what a chord is, and subsequently, you enslave your ability to play music to whether or not little dots and stems are available.  I can go on and on, but I’ll leave that for another note for another time.

Anyway, so yeah, I hated it.  Everything about the track was fine up until then.  MIDI sounded do-able, cajon sounded like a cajon, piano is in tune, etc.  **But the moment I slapped on my violin part (noises?), I could already hear the mean and useless comments on my less-than-stellar-violining on my YouTube channel.**  So the fires of passion quickly burned out and I was rather discouraged, and this production of “17 Sai” just…stowed away deep inside the Amaso Google Drive directory.

# The Encouraging Haunting Past

But if that’s where the story ends, then this post wouldn’t exist, right?  **In my recently loosely enforced desire to release one production a week, I decided to finish out 17 Sai (partly because the files for my other project are late…).**  I made this decision the same way I decided my initial major—arbitrarily, and without much thought.

The first thing I noticed was how messy the project files were.  And the reason was pretty obvious, I didn’t know what I was doing (not that I do now, though).  So I cleaned that up, and added some pretty colors:

<figure class="align-center">

    <figcaption><i>Figure 4: 2020 Project Desktop</i></figcaption>
</figure>

I also noticed my abysmal ability to hold a proper syncopated rhythm, let alone play remotely in tune, so I completely scrapped the 2018 solo violin part and re-recorded that…:

Hm, wasn’t much improvement, even with adding a viola to mix….Anyway…moving onn.

And that’s about it!  Cmd + S, Cmd + B, ship it.  Done.  Easy.  **Easy?  Maybe now, but apparently not for 2018 me.**  But, when I look through the 2018 project files, it wasn’t as if I didn’t know what the project was lacking.  When 2020 me felt that the MIDI was too soft, I can still see that the faders were maxed out in the 2018 project.  I clearly was trying to bump up the volume of the MIDI back in 2018, but I simply just didn’t know to increase the velocities of the MIDI notes instead.  **I knew what I wanted, but I didn’t know how to get what I wanted.**  Stuff like this was littered all over the project.  In the gain staging, in the instrument recording, and in the arrangement structure.

But writing a bunch of string arrangements, editing multiple Logic Pro X projects, and practicing the violin daily-ish over the span of two years have given me the words to voice better what I want to express.  Pretty cool to see that the things that I struggled with in 2018 are so easily fixed and improved upon in 2020.  As it is slightly encouraging at times to see how I’ve changed from 17 to 21, and 21 to 28, **sometimes it is encouraging to take a look at old pieces of works in detail to see how much you have grown.**  It actually brings a bit of solace to the present, just knowing that what you are doing now will become a point of encouragement for yourself in the future.

But not too much apparently, because I still have problems being in tune and staying in rhythm even in the 2020 version of this production, and that’s still pretty discouraging.  Lovely.

# Oh Right This is a Music Blog

I feel like these notes are becoming less and less about music, and more and more about muh life and me.  Sorry about that, my faithful readers who actually want to read about the music nitty gritties (do y’all exist?).  But don’t worry, I saved the best for last.

Just kidding, sorry.   **There’s not much to say on why I did what I did in what I did since the majority of the cover was brain dead replicating ideas from the original on a MIDI controller.**  This included copying the synths with MIDI, replicating the intro melody on the glockenspiel, and capturing the essence of the vocal harmonies on the chorus.  If you want to blame someone, blame 2018 me.  I am merely inheriting his will.  Though I guess, there’s actually an element in this cover that I introduced from outside of the original piece that I would like to point out.  It’s this fun run right here:

<figure class="align-center">
    <img src="/images/2020/04/07/figure-5-string-run-in-violin-1-and-2-of-the-string-ensemble.png" alt="">
    <figcaption><i>Figure 5: String Run in Violin 1 and 2 of the String Ensemble (Occurs at 1:12)</i></figcaption>
</figure>

I mentioned in previous notes on “Jesus, Strong and Kind” that the numero uno OST of 2019 was Shoujo Kageki Revue Starlight’s OST, and for good reason.  This run that I…borrowed…comes from [another song from that OST (the first few seconds)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WH2ilVznYM0).  It wasn’t the easiest to play, but I think the effort was well worth it.  The crunchy sound stemming from insisting that the run be played in a detached manner totally accelerates the crescendo into landing point.  Definitely hope that I can recycle this idea more often in the future, hehe.

# Concluding Remarks

Andrew Peterson remarks in his book “Adorning the Dark,” “Don’t write bad songs—but write the bad ones, too.”  **I was rather discouraged when I first wrote this project in 2018, but two years later, the same project files gave me a little bit of encouragement.**  I can only really find encouragement in looking at the original trash because I didn’t stop writing the bad stuff along the way.  Not to say the stuff I punch out now is much better, but I’d like to believe that it is at least a little bit further along.  

If you’re looking to git gud at something, just remember what Peterson said, and know that you will be (or at least ought to be) your worst critic.  **Creating something that you can stand behind is a very long and arduous process, that takes countless iterations of trial and error to take only a few baby steps forward.**  And if you’re anything like me, the smallest bits of encouragement and discouragement (from both yourself and people other than yourself) can either propel you into writing a 40 page piano quintet, or into contemplating whether to delete the project files and consider the project a total loss.

But both versions of me’s end up at the same call-to-action, and that is to **just give it a try**.  Don’t write bad songs, but write the bad ones, too.  At the very least, if it’s really bad, you can do what I did and leave it in a Google Drive to collect dust until you stumble upon it again.  Who knows, maybe that point of discouragement will become a point of encouragement two years later!
