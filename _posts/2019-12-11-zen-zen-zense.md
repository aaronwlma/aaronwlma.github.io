excerpt: "Be mindful of your shortcomings.  I spent a good amount of time on the production of RADWIMPS’ “Zen Zen Zense,” and I wasn’t quite satisfied with the result in the end.  To be transparent with my ups and downs, I recall three statements in this production note that I use to keep myself going in my musical journey."

<hr>

So my good friend got engaged a good 11 months ago, and as part of my groomsman duties, I had the privilege and honor to arrange a set of three songs from Kimi no Na Wa for his wedding (which just happened yesterday! Wow, time flies..).

I’ve been taking a look at my recent production notes, and I realized that they are a rather inaccurate representation of my perspective of my music.  Well, maybe not inaccurate, but maybe more like an incomplete picture.  So this time around, I decided to try and highlight more of the shortcomings this time around in efforts to be a little more transparent with my thoughts.

# Recollection #1: Compositions are Never Completed, Just Abandoned

So this arrangement of “Zen Zen Zense” by RADWIMPS was a request from a good friend of mine.  This friend of mine proposed to his now wife at the end of 2018, and wanted a string quartet version of the piece to play during the recessional of their wedding this past November.  For those of you who don’t like to count time, that meant that I had 10 months to roll this one out (more or less).

Now, that could be a blessing to some, but for me, it is more of a curse than anything.  My music professor at HKUST once said that “compositions are never completed, just abandoned,” and I find that the same for arrangements.  As you write and write and write, you never really feel satisfied with what you have (and sometimes, you even feel like you want to scrap the whole thing to start over).  So you tend to stay in a perpetual state of not really knowing if you’re done, or if you should give up.  This feeling never leaves, until someone other than you steps in, and tells you “time’s up, you’re done!”

To me, that person is a god send.  It forces me to be content with what I have, and allows me to move on from a piece.  But when you have 10 months of time available to you, it means you are suspended in the limbo state for a very, very long time.  It is not the best of feelings, haha.

Of course, anyone who writes a fair amount has developed their own ways of dealing with that.  One of the ways that I’ve been able to combat this feeling on my personal projects is by establishing recording days as I’m writing.  This forces me to finish by the time the musicians actually meet to play.  The other way that I have is by not starting a project until I get closer to a deadline.  Some of y’all may call that procrastinating, but I just like to believe I’m more efficient…and inspired…with some heavy pressure :D.

Unfortunately, I was not able to use either of my solutions on this project, and so I was constantly torn between being content with my production, and wanting to improve it to the standard I want to meet.  As that feeling ebbed and flowed, I never really left the piece, and worked well beyond the soft deadline.  Definitely not something that I ended being comfortable with.

# Recollection #2: Good Composition is Just Copying Others and Getting Away With it

Another phrase that my professor said was that “good composition is just copying others and getting away with it.”  A bit exaggerated with the whole shock factor there, but the intent of the statement was to emphasize that writers pull from their experiences (both in music and life) to weave together ideas into a story.  That said, this arrangement of ‘Zen Zen Zense” was similar.  My primary reference recording for this piece was JHMJam’s version [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onp7-rD2Va4).

If you listen to their jam session, you will find that my arrangement of “Zen Zen Zense” is very similar to theirs (if not nearly identical).  I basically took the structure of their jam session and copied that, even down to the clapping during the bridge.  I’m not particularly happy about that, as I like to pull from many of my inspirations to create something that can stand on its own.  But thank you, JHMJams, for having this arrangement available for me to model after.  Y’all too were a god send.

Oh, but the arrangement wasn’t just 100% JHMJams though, I did draw inspiration from other places to throw into this arrangement.  The [piano scale at 2:21](https://youtu.be/V87VHxL384Y?t=141) was inspired by the intro of [ZAQ’s Sparkling Daydream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FIAtrsMkPyM) from Chuunibyou Demo Koi ga Shitai.

Aaand [the piano dance during the verses](https://youtu.be/V87VHxL384Y?t=23) are inspired by the guitar in the original (hm, although can you really call that an inspiration if it’s just highlighting?).

And that’s about it!  Not very much right?  I agree as well.  It doesn’t really feel right to call this arrangement “my arrangement” because I felt like it wasn’t even an arrangement at all.  Frankly, it felt more like a transcription.  And to spend 8 months on and off, just for a transcription?  That is slightly disappointing.  I had really hoped that I would be able to contribute to the (massive) pool of Zen Zen Zense covers out there by providing something a little more colorful.

# Recollection #3: Practice Does Not Make Perfect, But Perfect Practice Makes Perfect...or Something

The last of of the recollections is from our pianist Matthew.  This live recording of Zen Zen Zense is in D major, but actually, the studio recording of this for my friend’s wedding was written in B major, since B major was the original key of the piece.  The reason I transposed the piece to D major was…because B major is too difficult to play at 184bpm.  B major has 5 sharps, and it is a key that strings do not play in very often.  To avoid accuracy issues, the practical performance solution to B major is to prioritize using 2nd position for violin, but 2nd position is also a position violins don’t play in very often either.

So the obvious solution is to, then, practice playing in 2nd position.  Well, the obvious solution to 90% of things in music is to practice.  But it’s kinda an overarching phrase that holds a lot of something but also a whole lot of nothing.  Everyone has his or her own ways of practicing, but having an efficient and productive practice regimen is what ultimately determines how far we can grow as musicians (along with feedback, but that is a story for another day).

But if you wait until a problem appears to address it, it is already too late.  2nd position and B major are not uncommon problems for string players, so I should have been already practicing in a manner to make sure I’d be comfortable when those appear.  But alas, not only did I not, but I also ended up running away from the problem in the live recording by transposing the piece to a manageable key.

# Concluding Remarks

Now, I did say that I wanted to be transparent with my thoughts on music, and so I let some of the negativity coursing through my veins spill a bit on the table.  I believe that constantly learning from everything is integral to my musical identity, so in order to walk away from this note on a productive note, I do want to highlight that I view the failures of this arrangement to be a positive.

As someone who is always advocating for routine practice, I think that it is good that my sub-par practice regimen came to light.  And as someone who is afraid of reaching a skill ceiling and never going beyond that, I think it is good to see that not everything that I write and record will be better than the next.  I mean, these are not new revelations, but recalling these shortcomings in this arrangement of Zen Zen Zense allow me to recall the heavy weight of these seemingly obvious observations.  As I play and write more and more, I am sure that the weight of the responsibility will only continue to get heavier.  But I want to believe that is a great thing.  I mean, like I said earlier, I am someone who works better under heavy pressure after all, so I’m sure it will only get better as time passes :).
