To ramp you (and my future self) up to speed, not much has changed in the past two months…EXCEPT THAT WE STARTED RECORDING KAMASO MUSIC! Woohoo. We finished recording Kiki’s in full, and Totoro in audio. Both recordings have taught me a lot on what I need vs. what I can slip by with, and what I hear vs what others hear. I think that in terms of music, it is great to get Kamaso Quartet moving. Website is partly up, and I hope that we can do many many recordings to come. That, however, is the only great news. But if you know me, wall of text never come from me because of good news. Yes, my dear reader, I am here again to dump thoughts that I have difficulty managing, and difficulty sharing.</p>\n<p>I guess let’s start with the trigger, and then follow with the cascading effects, and then end with what I see and feel. The past week, my friend received a full time position at Facebook. Doesn’t sound like much right? Let’s continue and outline an aspect of me that I absolutely loathe. this friend was my referral to my contracting position at Facebook, my first job out of college. As I went in, he left, and he went to bigger, better things. Three years passes, and he’s there, and I’m well, here. In inspiration of this friend, as well as Grace’s push to apply, I asked for and received a referral from Phebe this week, and a recruiter from Facebook reached out to me. Now, I have an informal chat with the recruiter next Tuesday. Looking at the position listed, I went to Glassdoor to check out what exactly I’m opting in to. The bottom line is…</p>\n<p>I’m totally screwed. At least for the position listed, it seems like the interview process is an intensive one, without any of my ability to avoid coding. If I even get to that point, I don’t think I’ll be able to show any form of code that will be convincing.</p>\n<p>So that brings me to my thoughts now, and it’s that I hate it. I look at my current situation and think, ah, another missed golden opportunity. “Why didn’t I do what I said I would do, 2 years ago?” “Am I capable enough to anyway?” “Will I get another chance?” I haven’t even talked to the recruiter and I’ve already began to count myself out.</p>\n<p>I think with all the success stories that I run into day after day, I’m having a harder time looking at myself in a good light. People younger than me getting married, people going to new places and seeing new things, people getting better jobs, higher paying jobs, jobs they love, jobs that enable. It’s hard to view myself in a positive light. Everything that I’ve used to justify my worth has been slowly taken away from me recently. Master’s? Oh yeah, LinkedIn totally just told me, all these jobs I’ve considered? Yeah 70-80% of applicants are Master’s graduates. Saving a lot from living at home? Oh yeah, your friends already have that in their savings, you’re still totally behind, and are still totally behind at the rate you save. You’re a fast learner? It’s been a year and a month now, your testing skills have not gotten any better. Everyone at work is better than you at that. Something that takes you a week to fix, someone can fix in 30 minutes. You’re a fun guy? When people pair up in couple it’s difficult to really find a space in any group to be “fun.”</p>\n<p>It feels day after day that my confidence in myself just gets slowly, slowly, taken away, until I’ve finally realized it and a wave of depression just hits. A “just let me have one thing I can be proud of in myself, I don’t have any right now.” kinda thought. And with the upcoming “informal chat” with the recruiter, I feel like the nail in the coffin is coming soon. I have a healthy dose of logic built into me, so I know how hard I’m going to take that. It’s going to take a while for me to get up and get past that rejection and use it to spur on into the future. I also know how much that will affect my psyche for a long time.</p>\n<p>I can see it being good for me, but at the same time I have that small window of hope where I just ask quietly to God, “can you let me be proud, just this once?” I don’t like to go before the Lord in artificial prayer, so when I go before him I just really ask for such a worldly thing, knowing that God’s plans for me isn’t in my worth on Earth. I know very, very well. I know…I know. “My worth is not in skill or name, in win or lose, in pride or shame.” Yet I come before the Lord, knowing all this, and still asking quietly. In a way, that feels actually pretty repulsive, and shockingly uncontrollable. I feel like in both “Yes” and “No,” God has something to teach me through this ordeal. I’ve thought I’ve always been a pretty good person at controlling and subverting the innate nature in myself, but seeing how uncontrollable my desires, hopes, and emotions run in this patch of life definitely point me toward seeing how far from being a good follower of Christ I am. I want to say it’s very humbling, but humbling has a positive connotation to it that I don’t think is accurate here. To me, this whole ordeal is definitely a negatively-feeling humbling process. I guess this is another one of those “tough love” times for me again.</p>\n<p>Anywho, that’s my DOTM on career this time around. To me it was a little unavoidable to bring in the spiritual part of my personal life that I don’t usually verbalize, but that is the current state for career. It looks like I’m running into the final nail in the coffin to show me the true state of my being. Hopefully I can recover, and stick to this 20/5/1.5 schedule I got going for myself. More on that next time.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Finding the Worth in the Things I Do","date":"2018-08-24T00:00:00.000Z"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2018-08-24-Finding-the-Worth-in-the-Things-I-Do/"}},
