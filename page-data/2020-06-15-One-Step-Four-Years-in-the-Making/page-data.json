I knew it was hard enough for many to get their foot in the door in some shape or form, so I felt like sitting there at my standing desk was already just by some stroke of divine intervention.</p>\n<p>I was already really happy with the opportunity that I was in, but there was a problem.</p>\n<p>I am an engineer.  Or well, I’d like to believe I am.  As amazing as the Facebook environment was, I could not shake off the idea of giving up on the field of engineering to continue down the route that the contracted opportunity presented.  “If only I could take what I have right now, and just swap my roles and responsibilities to engineering, then perhaps I would be in the ideal place.  What a crazy dream that would be.”  But there were sooo many things missing in my professional history to make that dream a reality.  Not only did I need to study up on a relatively different field of engineering, I also had to rack up enough professional experience if I wanted to collaborate with brightest of the bunch (presumably).  Transitioning from where my career was at to where I wanted to be would be jumping into a dark hole of endless work and study, with no guarantee of a better future on the other side.</p>\n<p>But I wouldn’t have been able to live with myself if I left such a dream as a “what-if” in life.  And so, with these thoughts in the back of my mind, and with the encouraging “I think you can do it” pep talk from my manager at the time, I left Facebook one year before my contracted period ended to give the lofty career transitioning dream a try, carrying with me the fear of possibly making the biggest career mistake in my life.</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://aaronwlma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-06-14-at-4.24.04-PM-1536x1004.png\">https://aaronwlma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-06-14-at-4.24.04-PM-1536x1004.png</a>]\r\nMe, making a lofty promise back in 2016 to return.\r\nBut today, I am more than happy to let y’all know that my fear of making a mistake comes to an end.  Because just three weeks ago, on May 19th, 2020, I was extended an offer for a new position as a Production Engineer at Facebook in Menlo Park under their Discover Production Engineering program!  Woohoo!  Yay!  Ahhh!  Ehhhh!  Hohooooo!</p>\n<p>SO.  In this post today, in addition to announcing that I will be re-migrating to NorCal this coming August, I would like to drop three key takeaways that I’ve clung to during the past two years of self-study.  I’m hoping that they may perhaps be encouraging to you.  If ya don’t vibe with that, feel free to finish reading here!  S’all good, I get it, it’s a freakin’ saga.  No need to feel obligated.  But for all y’all who love diarrhea of the mouth, buckle up cause we embarkin’ on an adventure today, hehe.</p>\n<p>Takeaway 1: Focus on the Theme, Not the Goal\r\nSomething that I noticed early on in my self-study was that goals are a little difficult to work with because they are so easily missed.  On a small scale, it can be something like “I’m going to finish writing this two-year takeaway post by Friday, June 14th!”  But on a large scale, that can be something like “I’m going to transition my career to software engineering in nine months!”  While setting these goals and missing them can be quite harmless in it themselves, missing goals sends a rather disappointing and discouraging message to the goal-setter, and what tends to happen is that Mr. Dreamer over there ends up waging a totally unnecessary internal war over their confidence in themselves.</p>\n<p>So, Mr. Dreamer finally reached his breaking point and decides to commit to something new.  What did he do next?  “I’m going to transition my career to software engineering–”  Great.  “–in nine months!”–No wait, stop.</p>\n<p>This was Mr. Dreamer’s mistake.  “Transition my career to software engineering” is a great theme, but tagging “in nine months” turned the theme into a goal.  This isn’t really obvious, but Mr. Dreamer here is actually me (SHOCKER).  I set a goal before myself and wrote out a huge battle plan to guide me from start to finish.  Here’s a picture of that altar, the whiteboard that detailed how I was doing for the duration of the theme.  Week 0 was the end of August 2018, and week 90 was the third week of May 2020:</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://aaronwlma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-06-14-at-4.30.22-PM.png\">https://aaronwlma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-06-14-at-4.30.22-PM.png</a>]\r\nBlack boxes mean I did all the hours I committed to doing, the minus number is how many hours I missed for that week.\r\nAnything stick out in particular?  Yup, surprise, surprise!  It did not take nine months (ANOTHER SHOCKER).  It took 22.  This whiteboard is great because it shows a lot of information, but what it doesn’t show is the HUGE problem that I created for myself behind the scenes.</p>\n<p>Boldly proclaiming a goal, only to miss it four times in a row, sucks.  You trap yourself into a position where you’re either a liar or a quitter.  Dunno about all y’all, but that was a lose-lose situation that I found myself in constant battle with each and every day for two years.</p>\n<p>So instead, remember to focus on the theme, not the goal.  While “in nine months” or “shed 20 pounds” or “play Canon in D on the guitar” is a GREAT place for a checkpoint, it should NOT be the determining factor for your success or failure.  Here’s a little excerpt during Month 5 out of 22 of my journey:</p>\n<p>I like to take the positive look toward this and say “In the past quarter, I did 224 hours toward bettering my career” instead of the negative “I failed to do 136 hours of what I expected.” –From <a href=\"https://aaronwlma.com/life/update-time/\">“Update Time for the End of 2018“</a></p>\n<p>When you commit yourself to a goal, frame the goal with the theme, and use the goals to give yourself feedback.  Focus on the theme and shield yourself from unnecessarily hurting yourself with your unrealistic expectations.  Define your progress and success with the things you did, and not the things you failed to do.</p>\n<p>Takeaway 2: Keep Pusheen On\r\nAlright, you did it.  You made your commitment, you set a battle plan to keep yourself in check.  You’re motivated, you’re inspired, you’re all good to go.  What now?  Well, work at it.  Easy, right?</p>\n<p>Here’s a story I’d like to share about a uh, friend of mine, yeah.  This friend of mine has some (trying to be nice to him here) problems.  His energy levels are unpredictable, his motivations are whimsical, and his favorite choice of orientation is horizontal.  He’s not entirely deadweight though;  Ask him to work on something for a day, he will have no problem doing that.  But ask him the next day, and the next, and the next.  Ask him every day, for the next two years.</p>\n<p>Commitment is easy when the time is short, because it only takes a little bit of Jordan’s Secret Stuff to get through a hump.  But when the hump becomes a mountain, suddenly the Secret Stuff just doesn’t do it for you.  Sometimes, you just need to take a breather.  And that’s all right.  But remember, the mountain doesn’t shrink, and time does not stop.  So if you want to catch the sunrise at the top, you may need to adjust your pace.  You may need to tell your friends and family who are willing to walk with you on this journey to go on without you, that you will catch up to them.  You may really struggle with just one step, alone, each and every day.</p>\n<p>But go ahead and struggle.  Work at it.  As alluded in the first takeaway, don’t define your success by what you haven’t been able to do, define it by what you have done.  And that only happens if you put your work in it every day and struggle.  In the midst of criticism, lethargy, physical concerns, and doubt, cast it aside for the moment and <a href=\"https://aaronwlma.com/career/keep-on-pusheen/\">keep. Pusheen. On</a>.  If you commit to that, you’re unstoppable:</p>\n<p>As long as I continue to respond to my guilt and disappointment with reinvigorated passion, I think in time, whether 6 months or 5 years, I’ll one day find the strength and determination to make a strong jump backwards into the career line that’s next to me. —From “<a href=\"https://aaronwlma.com/life/the-end-to-the-first-half-of-2018/\">The End to the First Half of 2018</a>“</p>\n<p>Tangent side thought:  For all my readers out there that my analogy is being drawn from an experience outside my career, great job!  I actually had my hike to Roy’s Peak in New Zealand back in 2019 in mind when I wrote this part.  My friends and I woke up at 3am to hike in the dark up to catch the sunrise at the top.  But, because I am a fatty, I actually wasn’t able to reach summit in time with my friends to catch the sunrise.  I told them to go ahead without me, and I ended up enjoying the sunrise alone with a stranger in silence, just short a quarter mile away from the summit.</p>\n<p>I had a crazy hiker’s high during this moment and actually choked up a bit when I came to the realization that it’s not a failure that I didn’t summit with my friends in time for sun rise, but that it’s a complete success that I traveled 6500 miles to wake up at 3am to hike 3935ft up to see the world doing its world things.  I’m not usually a sappy person, but I gotta be honest, that was fasho a life changing moment.</p>\n<p>Here’s a pic I took near the summit so y’all can vibe with my moment of uh, transcendence 😀</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://aaronwlma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/photo_20190423074254_6619158_0-1-1536x864.jpg\">https://aaronwlma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/photo_20190423074254_6619158_0-1-1536x864.jpg</a>]\r\nCrazy to say but, the pictures didn't do it justice man.\r\nTakeaway 3: Choose Positoovity\r\nThis one is the shortest one to explain, but also probably the most important one to me because this one is probably the most deeply personal.  I think that somewhere along my road of life going from young to old(er),  pessimism and negativity settled in and built a home to stay…forever.  As the glint of light slowly faded from my eyes, eyes of a critic and and a skeptic crept in as I was forced to see that there is injustice, things are unfair, people have agendas, and things just aren’t the way they probably should be.  It really throws you down in the dumps, because a lot of times, you don’t have any individual power to fix what you believe is broken.</p>\n<p>I purposely put the takeaway to be “choose” positoovity, and not “be” positiv..e (dang it my Little Mermaid pun), because when I was losing my eyesight back in 2014, I didn’t understand how to “be” positive.  There is a sense of ignoring the negative when you “be” positive that I am not particularly fond of.  “Be”ing positive was like looking to the positive and saying “at least I’m not blind yet.”  I was laying down…face down thinkin’…homie I mean you ain’t wrong but who’s gonna love a disabled short dude…and whoever ends up crazy enough to do that…they gonna have to deal with this forever..and this…and that…and that…</p>\n<p>Insisting on “be”ing positive is very much like focusing yourself to the ideas of positivity, while ignoring the negative.  But when you “choose” positivity, I think the wording is a little more empowering to let you know that you are in control of your Self.  When you choose to be positive, you look at the negative straight in the face and say “you are all 100% right, and I have nothing to discount what you are.  But even so, I reject you in favor of another outlook.“</p>\n<p>During my two years self studying, negative after negative after negative would spawn from the corners of my life.  Younger friends and family <a href=\"https://aaronwlma.com/life/worth/\">get a better job</a>, get married, <a href=\"https://aaronwlma.com/career/exercising-patience/\">get a new home</a>, etc. and causing you to think that you are falling behind.  Friends and family reaching into your life to tell you what you should be doing without putting effort into knowing what you have been doing.  Current and old companies telling you in distasteful or gentle ways that <a href=\"https://aaronwlma.com/career/keep-on-pusheen/\">you aren’t fit for the role you’re applying to</a>.  A freakin’ pandemic hits when you need time alone to study the most, but the company deems you essential and forces you to show up on site while your friends and family venture into the work from home life.</p>\n<p>Things just keep comin’ and comin’ and comin’, and instead of saying “well, let’s focus in on the positive, that is you have a healthy balance of life?!“,  I have found it so much more productive to say “Good lordie all of this is really, really, wrong, but even so, I will choose to look at what is good and right in my vision and fix my eyes on that.”  It was by choosing to opt in to a positive outlook in light of the massive negative that has empowered me to not give up even when I didn’t really think I was goin’ at it right anymore.</p>\n<p>When you fully embrace and accept what is negative, but choose to reject it, you already have won in becoming a slightly better version of yourself…until the next day where the process will repeat again.  Fight the good fight homies.</p>\n<p>I am just as negative as everyone else, and so I hope that by conducting myself in a manner to exemplify a positive outlook would be a testament to those struggling in my community to see the positives that emerge from a cesspool of negatives. —From “Be ‘Do’-ers”</p>\n<p>Concluding Remarks\r\nSo there y’all have it.  Three takeaways off the top of my head from my two year dedication to <a href=\"https://aaronwlma.com/life/journey-to-the-north/\">journey to the North</a>.  I actually have probably like hundreds of takeaways, and I totally lost a bit of focus along the way in this post, but these were the three that I felt most compelled to write today.</p>\n<p>Now, one thing I feel compelled to clarify before I tie things up is that I’m no different as a person today as I was three weeks ago.  I’ve been doing this whole “do-ing” business for two years now, and I don’t intend to stop now, because there will always be aspects of the Self that I can improve on.  The only difference between today and three weeks ago is that now, a company that I highly regard has stepped into my life and said, “hey, what you’ve been doing is awesome, join us and keep at it.”  The journey is 1% finished, and I am quite enjoying this adventure, so I plan to only keep Pusheen on at the 99% in a similar fashion.</p>\n<p>I’ve learned a lot in the past two years, so I gave up on trying to make this post brief and succinct.  But if you made it all the way down here, and would still like to hear more about career step forward, feel free to reach out to me!  Maybe I haven’t talked to you in years, or maybe I haven’t talked to you in minutes.  I’d love to reconnect for as short and long as you’d like to exchange thoughts!</p>\n<p>Soli Deo Gloria and Jesu Juva,</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Aaron Ma</li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"title":"Face to Face - One Step Four Years in the Making","date":"2020-07-15T00:00:00.000Z"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2020-06-15-One-Step-Four-Years-in-the-Making/"}},
